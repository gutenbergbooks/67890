<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> white-capped nurse dropped the curtains
in place so that they completely shut out
the night and equally prevented any
ray of artificial light penetrating the outer darkness.
Her eyes, blinded by her steadfast gaze into
the whirling snow storm, were slow in adjusting
themselves to the lamp lighted room and for some
minutes she saw as in a blur the spare form of the
physician standing by her patient&rsquo;s bed. Doctor
Roberts turned at her approach and removed his
finger from about the man&rsquo;s wrist. He met her
glance with a negative shake of his head as he replaced
his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abbott!&rdquo; he called softly, bending over the patient:
&ldquo;Rouse yourself and take some nourishment.
You will never get your strength back if you don&rsquo;t
eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly, languidly Abbott&rsquo;s dark eyes opened and
regarded the two figures by his bedside. They lingered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
in some curiosity on the trim figure of the
trained nurse and then passed on to the physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat later,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Leave me alone,
now,&rdquo;&mdash;and the heavy lids closed again over the
eyes under which dark circles of pain testified to
hours of suffering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Doctor Roberts spoke more crisply.
&ldquo;Miss Ward will be here to look after you. You
must do what she says. I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning.
Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His remark met with no response, and picking up
his bag Roberts started from the room. At the door
he paused and motioned to Miss Ward to follow
him. Stopping long enough to arrange Abbott&rsquo;s
pillow in a more comfortable position, the nurse
went into the hall, only to find that Doctor Roberts
was halfway down the staircase. With a doubtful
look behind her, Miss Ward ran lightly down into
the lower hall which, lighted only by oil lamps, was
long and rambling and used as a living room. Doctor
Roberts walked over to a table and put down
his bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you are here, Miss Ward,&rdquo; he began,
courteously. &ldquo;I feared the storm would detain
you. You have not nursed for me before?&rdquo;&mdash;with
an inquisitive glance at the pretty woman before
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Doctor.&rdquo; Miss Ward&rsquo;s tapering fingers
pressed out a crease in her starched gown. &ldquo;This
is my first case since my arrival in Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! You are a graduate nurse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I trained in New York.&rdquo; Her hazel eyes
met his steadily. &ldquo;They told me at the hospital of
the urgency of this case and I took a taxi out here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right. Add all your expenses to your
bill,&rdquo; directed Roberts. &ldquo;Paul Abbott has ample
means. He should be in a hospital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But his condition, doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts nodded. &ldquo;That is out of the question,&rdquo;
he agreed, &ldquo;<i>now</i>. Had his caretaker sent for me
in time I would have had Mr. Abbott moved from
this God-forsaken location to the city. As it is&rdquo;&mdash;he
pulled himself up short&mdash;&ldquo;we must do the best
we can ten miles from civilization.&rdquo; His smile vanished
as quickly as it had come. &ldquo;I am no lover
of the country in the dead of winter. What time
did you get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An hour ago. Have you any orders, doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can give him a dose of this through the
night&rdquo;&mdash;taking out a small phial and handing it to
her&mdash;&ldquo;the directions are on the bottle. It is essential
that Mr. Abbott have sleep; if necessary,
give him this by hypodermic.&rdquo; And he handed her
two pellets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What stimulation do you wish me to use in case
of sudden collapse?&rdquo; Miss Ward asked as Roberts
picked up his bag and walked toward the front
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strychnine, twentieth of a grain,&rdquo; brusquely, as
the hall clock chimed ten, but his hurried exit was
checked by a further question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Abbott any family to be notified in case
his condition becomes dangerous?&rdquo; asked Miss
Ward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No immediate relations.&rdquo; Doctor Roberts was
manifestly impatient to be off. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a girl&mdash;Betty
Carter&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not sure that the engagement
isn&rsquo;t broken. Good night.&rdquo; The high wind drove
the snow, which had drifted up on the broad veranda,
in whirling gusts through the front door and half
blinded Roberts as he held it partly open. With a
muttered oath he dashed outside to his automobile,
parked under the shelter of the <i>porte cochère</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Ward heard the whir of the starting motor,
the grinding of weed chains and the shifting of
gears before she closed the outer vestibule door.
It was with a sense of reluctance that she turned
back into the silent house. The storm and her surroundings
oppressed her.</p>

<p>The old homestead, turned from a large-sized,
roomy farmhouse into a hunting lodge, with its wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
entrance hall converted into a living room from
which ran numerous twisting passages, was a gloomy
place in winter. Through darkened doorways Miss
Ward obtained a vague impression of larger rooms
beyond which she judged to be library, dining room,
and possibly a sunparlor.</p>

<p>Paul Mason Abbott, Senior, had prospered in his
real estate business, and had acquired, in one of his
deals, the country property, twenty miles from
Washington, the National Capital, which, with a
substantial fortune, he had bequeathed to his only
son, Paul. The latter&rsquo;s career as a promising young
architect had been interrupted by the World War.
Paul had borne his share of the fighting, returning
to his home with health shattered and a morbid
desire to live alone.</p>

<p>He had closed his bachelor apartment in Washington
in the early spring and spent the following
months motoring about the country. Just before
Christmas he had appeared unexpectedly at Abbott&rsquo;s
Lodge and announced that he would reside there
indefinitely. Corbin, the caretaker, had given him
but a taciturn welcome, and neither he nor his wife
had done more than provide Abbott with three meals
a day and such heat as was absolutely necessary to
warm the house.</p>

<p>Miriam Ward felt that even Corbin&rsquo;s presence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
disagreeable as she had found the caretaker in her
one interview with him upon her arrival, was preferable
to the grotesque shadows made by the furniture
as she hurried across the living room and up
the staircase to her patient. Paul Abbott paid no
attention to her as she moved about making her
preparations for a long night&rsquo;s vigil.</p>

<p>Abbott&rsquo;s bedroom stretched across one wing of
the house. Miss Ward was conscious of a touch
of envy as she subconsciously took note of the
lovely old pieces of mahogany with which the room
was furnished&mdash;the highboy with its highly polished
brass handles, the fine old bureau with its quaint
mirror hanging above it; the antique desk in one
corner and last, but not least, the carved four-post
bedstead with its canopy and its long curtains. The
handsome rugs on the floor deadened her footsteps
as she moved about, and it was with a sense of
shock that she heard the grandfather clock in the
hall chime the hour of midnight. The sudden sound
in the utter stillness aroused Paul Abbott as he
seemed about to drop off to sleep and he lifted his
head. Instantly Miss Ward was by his side, but
he pushed away the glass of milk she offered him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she come?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She? Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>
<p>Miss Ward shook her head. Then observing his
feverish condition more closely, she hastened to say
soothingly: &ldquo;She will probably be here as soon as
the storm lets up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abbott looked at her appealingly. Thrusting his
fingers inside the pocket of his pajamas he drew
out a crumpled piece of paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty wrote that she would be here to-night,&rdquo;
he protested. &ldquo;And you must let her in&mdash;you
must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo; Miss Ward again offered the rejected
glass of milk. &ldquo;Drink this,&rdquo; she coaxed, and obedient
to the stronger will Abbott took a few swallows
and then pushed the glass away. His head slipped
back upon the pillow and Miss Ward deftly arranged
the curtain of the four-poster so that it
sheltered his eyes from the light of the wood fire
burning on the hearth at the opposite end of the
bedroom.</p>

<p>An hour later she was about to replenish the wood
for the third time when a distant peal of a door
bell caused her to drop the kindling with unexpected
suddenness in the center of the hot ashes. As the
sparks flew upward, she heard Abbott call out and
turned toward the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Betty!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a feeble wave
of his hand. &ldquo;Go&mdash;go&mdash;let her in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, but don&rsquo;t excite yourself,&rdquo; she cautioned.
&ldquo;Lie down on your pillows, Mr. Abbott, and keep
yourself covered,&rdquo; drawing the eiderdown quilt
over his shoulders as she spoke.</p>

<p>Another, and more imperative peal of the bell
caused her to hasten across the bedroom and into
the hall. She peered ahead expectantly as she went
down the staircase, hoping for a glimpse of the
caretaker, Corbin. Evidently the bell had not disturbed
his slumbers, for she could distinguish no one
approaching in the semi-darkness. Unfamiliar as
she was with her surroundings it took Miss Ward
several minutes to let down the night latch and turn
the old-fashioned key in the lock of the vestibule
door. As she swung the latter open she was pushed
back and two figures stepped across the threshold,
closing the door behind them. The first, a tall
slender girl, her handsome fur coat covered with
snow, stopped halfway to the staircase and addressed
Miss Ward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Abbott?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;And
why have you kept us waiting so long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume the caretaker is still asleep,&rdquo; replied
the nurse. &ldquo;Otherwise the door would have been
opened more promptly. Mr. Abbott is ill in bed.
Very ill,&rdquo; she added, meeting the girl&rsquo;s imperious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
glance with a steady gaze. &ldquo;This is no hour for
visitors for a sick man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the hour!&rdquo; The girl turned disdainfully
away. &ldquo;I must see Mr. Abbott; it is imperative.
You are the nurse?&rdquo; with a questioning glance at
her white uniform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and as such in charge of the sick room,&rdquo;
crisply. &ldquo;I cannot permit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; broke in the girl&rsquo;s companion,
who, until that instant, had busied himself with
closing both the vestibule and inner front door. As
he stepped closer and unbuttoned his heavy overcoat
Miss Ward caught a glimpse of his clerical dress.
&ldquo;This is Miss Elizabeth Carter, Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s
fiancée, and I am Dr. Nash of Washington. Miss
Carter received word that Mr. Abbott is alarmingly
ill&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With small hope for his recovery.&rdquo; The words
escaped Betty Carter through quivering lips, and
looking closely at her, Miss Ward discovered her
eyelashes wet with tears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep us standing
here when time is so precious,&rdquo; and turning she ran
up the staircase, followed by the clergyman and
Miss Ward.</p>

<p>An odd sound far down the corridor caused the
nurse to hesitate before accompanying the others
into the sick room, and for several seconds she stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
poised outside the door, her head bent in a listening
attitude. The sound, whatever it was, and Miss
Ward could have sworn it was a faint whimper, was
not repeated. She was thankful to turn from the
contemplation of the dark, winding corridor to
the companionship of her patient and his two belated
visitors.</p>

<p>Dr. Nash had paused by the solitary lamp, but his
efforts to induce it to burn more brightly resulted
in extinguishing it entirely, leaving the bedroom
illuminated by the firelight only. He turned at Miss
Ward&rsquo;s approach and addressed her in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get the lamp from downstairs,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;This one is burned out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty Carter, paying no attention to the others,
halted by the bedside just as Miss Ward started for
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come, Paul,&rdquo; Miss Ward heard her say as
she darted out of the room. &ldquo;I am here to keep my
word. Dr. Nash is with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Ward&rsquo;s mystification lent wings to her feet,
but when she made the turn of the last landing
of the staircase her foot slipped on some snow left
on the hardwood by the clergyman&rsquo;s rubbers, and
she went headlong to the floor. Considerably shaken
by her fall, it was some moments before she could
pull herself together and get to her feet. Taking up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the lamp with a hand not quite steady, she walked
upstairs. As she entered the bedroom she saw Betty
Carter standing apparently just where she had left
her and Doctor Nash closing his prayerbook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... I pronounce you man and wife.&rdquo; The
solemn words rang their meaning into Miss Ward&rsquo;s
ears as she took in the significance of the scene.
&ldquo;Come, Betty, we have no time to linger,&rdquo; and stepping
forward, Doctor Nash laid his hand on the
girl&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>With a gesture as if awakening from a dream,
Betty Carter raised her head and faced Miss Ward.
The nurse almost cried out as she met the full gaze
of her tragic eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you are not going?&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Now&mdash;after&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s beauty was of an unusual type
and Miss Ward&rsquo;s heart gave a sympathetic throb as
she came under the magnetism of her personality.
&ldquo;We&mdash;I will be back,&rdquo; and before Miss Ward could
gasp out a question, she hurried swiftly from the
room, the clergyman at her heels.</p>

<p>Her mind in a daze, Miss Ward stood in the doorway
of the bedroom holding the lighted lamp so
that they might see their way to the staircase, but
her half-formed intention of carrying the lamp to
the head of the stairs altered when she saw that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
clergyman was provided with a powerful pocket
searchlight. She stood where she was until she heard
the front door close with a distinct slam, then went
thoughtfully into the bedroom.</p>

<p>Placing the lamp on a small table by the side of
the bed, she drew back the curtain of the four-poster
and looked down at the sick man. He lay partly on
one side, his eyes closed, and one hand tightly clenching
the eiderdown quilt. For one long minute Miss
Ward regarded him, her senses reeling.</p>

<p>The man lying in the bed was not her patient.</p>

<span class="reduce">CAUGHT IN THE WEB</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>&nbsp;<span class="smcap">long-drawn</span> sigh cut the stillness.
Slowly Miriam Ward raised her head and
struggled to a more upright position. Her
limbs felt stiff and cramped and she moved with
difficulty. Without comprehension she watched a
beam of light creep from underneath a window curtain
and extend across the floor, its radiance widening
as the sun rose higher in the heavens. The
current of air from the opened window blowing
indirectly upon her overcame her sense of suffocation,
but her wild stare about the bedroom did not
bring recollection in its train. The first thing to fix
her attention was the fireplace and the darkened
hearth&mdash;no heat was given out by the dead embers.
Suddenly conscious of the chill atmosphere, she
involuntarily grasped her dress and dragged it closer
about her neck. The touch of the starched linen
caused her to glance downward. She was wearing
her uniform, therefore she was on duty!</p>

<p>Miriam Ward&rsquo;s dulled wits slowly adjusted themselves.
She had reported for duty at the Registry;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
a call had come&mdash;from where? To attend whom?
Roberts? No, that was the name of the physician.
Ah, she had it&mdash;Paul Abbott. The chord of memory
was touched at last and the events of the night
crowded upon her. The man in the bed&mdash;</p>

<p>Stiffly Miriam scrambled to her feet and made a
few halting steps to the bedside. It took all her will-power
to pull aside the bed curtains and glance down.
Paul Abbott lay partly turned upon his side, his fine
profile outlined against the white pillowcase, and his
right hand just showing outside the eiderdown
quilt.</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s hand tightened its grasp on the curtain
and she leaned weakly against the side of the bed;
but for its support her trembling knees would have
given way under her. She had been the victim of a
nightmare! The midnight visit of Betty Carter and
the clergyman, the substitution of a stranger for her
patient&mdash;all had been a hallucination conjured up by
a too vivid imagination. She had slept on duty.
That, in itself, was an unpardonable offense.</p>

<p>Raising her arm she glanced at her wrist watch&mdash;the
hands registered a quarter past eight. Then
nearly nine hours had passed and she had lain asleep.
A wave of color suffused her white face and she
grew hot and cold by turns. Her heart was beating
with suffocating rapidity as she hurried to the windows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
and drew aside the long, heavy curtains and
pulled up the Holland shades. The storm of the
night before was over and the winter sunshine
brought a touch of warmth to the room and a sense
of comfort.</p>

<p>A glance at the fireplace convinced Miriam that it
would require both time and fresh kindling wood to
start a fire. It could wait until she had summoned
the caretaker; the room was not so cold now that
she had closed the window.</p>

<p>Retracing her footsteps she again paused by the
bed and gazed at her patient. He still lay on his side,
motionless. Miriam Ward caught her breath&mdash;motionless,
aye, too motionless. A certain rigidity, a
waxen pallor, indistinguishable in her first glimpse
of him in the darkened room, held her eyes, trained
to detect the slightest alteration in a patient&rsquo;s condition.
Her hand sought his wrist, then his heart,
then dropped limply to her side. Paul Abbott lay
dead before her.</p>

<p>Her low cry was smothered in the bed curtain,
which she pressed against her mouth, and for a
moment she swayed dizzily upon her feet. Paul
Abbott had died while she lay asleep within a few
feet of his bed. Overwhelming remorse deadened
every other feeling and held her spellbound. Fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
five minutes elapsed before a sense of duty aroused
her to action.</p>

<p>Wheeling around, Miriam staggered rather than
walked to the telephone standing on Abbott&rsquo;s desk.
She had jotted down Doctor Roberts&rsquo; &rsquo;phone call the
night before, but it took her several seconds to get
the central at Washington, and still others passed
before a man&rsquo;s voice told her that the physician was
out making his morning rounds. At her urgent
request the servant promised to locate Doctor Roberts
and send him at once to Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.</p>

<p>As Miriam replaced the receiver on its hook she
was conscious of a feeling of deadly nausea and she
stumbled as she walked across the room and into
the hall. She must have aid. Her repeated calls
brought no response. What had become of the caretaker
and his wife? A noise of some one moving in
the hall below caused her to run down the staircase
to the lower landing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here, this way!&rdquo; she gasped, and saw
vaguely outlined a woman&rsquo;s terrified face in front
of her while the sound of a heavy tread coming down
the staircase echoed in her ears. &ldquo;Mr. Abbott&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
Voice and strength failed her simultaneously, and
before any one could reach her she lay in a crumpled
heap on the landing, unconscious of the loud ringing
of the gong over the front door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>
<p>It was approaching noon when a timid knock at
her bedroom door brought Miriam Ward into the
corridor and face to face with the caretaker&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Miss, the doctor says do you feel
better?&rdquo; The question came in a gasp, characteristic
of Martha Corbin. A gray ghost of a woman, timid
to the verge of cowardice, she seldom spoke unless
addressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; replied the trained nurse. &ldquo;Where
is Doctor Roberts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In there,&rdquo; with a jerk of her thumb over her
shoulder. &ldquo;He wants to see ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Miriam Ward closed her bedroom
door with a firm hand. She had regained some hold
upon her composure as her attacks of nausea ceased
and the throbbing in her head lessened. Doctor
Roberts had left her two hours before with the
admonition to remain in bed until he saw her again,
but her anxiety of mind had prevented her following
his directions. She paused involuntarily outside of
Paul Abbott&rsquo;s bedroom, then, gathering courage, she
stepped inside. Doctor Roberts turned at the sound
of her approach and put down the telephone instrument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are up,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;Well, how are
you? Feeling stronger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; thank you, Doctor.&rdquo; In spite of her determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
effort to keep her voice expressionless, Miriam
was conscious that it was not quite steady. &ldquo;I&mdash;oh,
Doctor, I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo; Her pent-up
emotion was gaining the upper hand. &ldquo;How to tell
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; as she paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that&mdash;I slept on duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Roberts eyed her steadily for what seemed
an interminable minute. &ldquo;So that was it,&rdquo; he remarked
dryly. &ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nurse&rsquo;s pallor was intensified, but her eyes did
not falter in their direct gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was asleep when Mr. Abbott died,&rdquo; she admitted,
her hands clenching themselves in the pockets
of her uniform.</p>

<p>Doctor Roberts&rsquo; stare grew prolonged. &ldquo;And this
was your first case in Washington?&rdquo; he asked, with
marked emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Miriam Ward moistened her dry lips
with the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly a successful début,&rdquo; commented Roberts.
His glance strayed beyond the nurse to a man standing
in the shadow of a window curtain. &ldquo;Give Miss
Ward a chair, Alan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somewhat startled by the presence of a third person,
Miriam accepted the proffered seat with relief;
she was weaker than she had at first realized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ward,&rdquo; continued Doctor Roberts, &ldquo;this is
Mr. Alan Mason, of the Washington <i>Post</i>. He
arrived here in time to carry you to your bedroom
and then summoned me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam glanced upward and encountered the gaze
of a pair of deep blue eyes fixed upon her in
concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not have gotten up,&rdquo; Alan declared,
and the human sympathy in his voice brought a lump
in her throat. She saw his clear-cut features, wavy
dark hair, and whimsical mouth through a mist
which she strove to wink away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you
have overdone things a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam shook her head. &ldquo;I could not rest in my
bedroom,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There must be something
that I can do, Doctor Roberts; unless you distrust
me too much.&rdquo; Her voice shook with feeling, and
she paused abruptly, unable to go on.</p>

<p>The two men exchanged glances, then Roberts
rose. &ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; he exclaimed, a trifle awkwardly.
&ldquo;Just take things quietly, Miss Ward, while
Alan asks you a few questions. It is his business,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo; Alan Mason nodded reassuringly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a reporter and also a cousin of Paul&rsquo;s; in fact,
his nearest relative. How did Paul seem last night&mdash;before
you fell asleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;&rdquo; Her pause was infinitesimal. &ldquo;He appeared
much excited, even irrational, but at times his
mind was perfectly clear. He took a little nourishment.&rdquo;
She stopped and passed one hand before
her eyes. Her dreams still haunted her. Could she
truthfully say where imagination had dovetailed with
reality? Was Betty Carter&rsquo;s visit, her marriage to
Paul Abbott but a figment of her overcharged brain?
Would her hearers think her a lunatic as well as
criminally negligent if she went into details?</p>

<p>Doctor Roberts broke the pause. &ldquo;I have looked
over your chart,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;and find that the last
entry was made soon after midnight. You made
no record of any marked change in his condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam swallowed hard. &ldquo;The collapse must have
come suddenly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At what time do you
think he died?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts eyed her in silence for a minute. &ldquo;Come
over to the bed,&rdquo; he directed, and not waiting for
her, turned on his heel.</p>

<p>The long side curtains of the four-post bedstead
were stretched across it, and as Miriam laid her hand
on one of them to draw it aside, Alan Mason checked
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found this wad of cotton under the bed,&rdquo; he
began. &ldquo;Had you any occasion last night to use
chloroform?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Miriam looked at him in startled wonder.
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Roberts scanned her closely, &ldquo;how comes
it that you, a trained nurse, are unaware that you
were chloroformed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly Miriam took in the meaning of his words.
&ldquo;Chloroformed?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;<i>I?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Alan Mason who answered and not Doctor
Roberts. &ldquo;I detected the odor of chloroform
when I carried you to your bedroom,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So
then I came in here&mdash;found my cousin, Paul, dead&mdash;and
this cotton under the bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam stared at her companions in dumbfounded
silence for a moment. &ldquo;My attack of nausea&mdash;&rdquo; she
faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the result of the chloroform,&rdquo; declared
Doctor Roberts. His voice deepened. &ldquo;We also
detected its odor about Paul Abbott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Miriam drew back. &ldquo;Was Mr.
Abbott anesthetized?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts&rsquo; gaze never left her face in the lengthened
pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, why don&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo;
Miriam looked piteously from one man to the other.
&ldquo;Was Mr. Abbott chloroformed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Roberts. &ldquo;He was stabbed in the
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<p>Dragging aside the curtains, Miriam gazed in
horror at the bed. The bedclothes had been pulled
back and Paul Abbott lay upon his face. Under his
left shoulder blade was a dark and sinister bloodstain.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">lan Mason</span> stopped his restless pacing
back and forth and looked at his watch&mdash;two
o&rsquo;clock. Surely, the autopsy must be over!
He had waited for what appeared an interminable
time for the County coroner, his assistant and Doctor
Roberts to join him in the living room as they
had promised. The afternoon papers would soon be
off the press and distributed to the public; it would
not be long before the reporters from the other local
papers and even the representatives of the great news
services located in the National Capital would be at
Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge in search of the sensational. And
they would find it! Alan&rsquo;s lips were compressed in
a hard line. Only six months before he and his
cousin, Paul Abbott, had been the closest of &ldquo;buddies,&rdquo;
then had come the estrangement and now
death.</p>

<p>Paul had been a social favorite, liked by one and
all, and while he had absented himself from Washington
during the past year, his tragic death would
come as a great shock to his many friends. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Betty Carter&mdash;what of her? Alan raised his hands
to his temples and brushed his unruly hair upward
until it stood on end. The action did not bring any
solution of his problems, and with a groan he
resumed his restless walk about the living room.</p>

<p>In remodeling the house, Paul Abbott, Senior, had
thrown several small rooms into one, also taking
down the partitions which inclosed the old-fashioned
square staircase, and made the whole into a combination
of hallway and living room. He had shown
excellent taste in furnishing the old house, using in
most instances the mahogany which had been in the
family for generations, and when necessary to purchase
other pieces of furniture he had hunted in
highways and byways for genuine antiques.</p>

<p>But Alan was in no frame of mind to appreciate
rare pieces of Hepplewhite, Sheraton, and Chippendale.
Tired of the monotony of his surroundings,
he strolled into the dining room and walked moodily
across it, intending to pour out a glass of water from
a carafe on the sideboard. The room was square in
shape, with two bow windows and a door leading
into a sunparlor which, in summer, the elder Abbott
had used as a breakfast room, as the large pantry
gave access into it as well as into the regular dining
room. From where he stood by the sideboard, Alan
could overlook, through one of the bow windows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the garden entrance to the sunparlor. The snow had
formed in high drifts, covering completely the rosebushes
which, as he recollected, surrounded a plot
of grass in the center of which stood an old sundial.
It also was blanketed in snow.</p>

<p>As he gazed idly out of the window, Alan saw
the door of the sunparlor swing slowly outward.
The piled-up snow caused it to jam and he watched
with some amusement the efforts of Corbin, the
caretaker, to squeeze his portly frame through the
partly open door. Once outside Corbin used his
snow shovel with vigorous strokes until he had
cleared the topmost step. Closing the door to the
sunparlor, he leaned his shovel against it, took out
his pipe, lighted it, tossed away the match, and
drawing on his woolen mitts, he wiped the snow
from one of the panes of window glass. Pausing
deliberately he glanced about him, and then, cupping
his hands, he pressed them against the window and
peered inside the sunparlor. Something furtive in
the man&rsquo;s action claimed Alan&rsquo;s attention, and he
drew back into the protection of the window curtain.
The precaution was unnecessary. Corbin
straightened up and without a glance at the dining
room window, took from his pocket a small metal
case. Whatever its contents it drew a smile so evil
that Alan stared at the man aghast. He had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
been prepossessed in the man&rsquo;s favor on the few
occasions when visiting Paul Abbott, Senior, and his
son before the war, and had wondered at Paul
retaining him in his employ after his father&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>Returning the case to his pocket, Corbin cleaned
the snow from the remaining steps and commenced
to shovel a path toward the kitchen. He had almost
completed the distance when he paused, stared
thoughtfully around him, and then walked back
to the sunparlor, clambered cumbersomely up the
steps to the door and again peered inside. Fully
two minutes passed before he stepped down and
walked along the shoveled path.</p>

<p>His curiosity piqued by the man&rsquo;s behavior, Alan
waited until Corbin had disappeared from sight,
then, turning on his heel, he entered the sunparlor.
Evidently Paul had used the room as a lounge, for
the wicker furniture, with its attractive cretonne
covering, looked homelike and comfortable. Magazines,
several books, and a smoking set were on
the nearest table, while flower boxes on two sides
of the sunparlor added a touch of the tropics, with
their hothouse plants. Alan walked past a wicker
sofa and several wing chairs grouped at one end
and halted abruptly at sight of Miriam Ward lying
asleep in one of the long lounging chairs. She had
not heard him enter, for she slept on&mdash;the deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
sleep, as Alan judged from her heavy breathing,
of utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>Alan turned and stared about the sunparlor. Except
for himself and the trained nurse, the room
was empty. What then had absorbed Corbin&rsquo;s attention?
Could it have been Miss Ward? He easily
detected the particular pane of glass through which
the caretaker had peered so intently. Miss Ward
was seated directly in its line of vision. What was
there about the nurse to make Corbin evince such
interest in her?</p>

<p>Alan drew a step closer and stared at the sleeping
girl with critical eyes. A little above the medium
height of women, slender, well proportioned, her
small feet shod in perfectly fitting low white shoes,
which showed a very pretty ankle, she lay snuggled
down in the cushions. He noted the clear olive of
her skin, the deep dimple, almost a cleft, in her
chin, the long, heavy lashes, the delicate arch of her
finely marked eyebrows, and the soft and abundant
hair, which she wore low on her forehead. He
judged her to be not over twenty-six and wondered
at the pathetic droop of her small mouth. Even in
repose there was a suggestion of sadness, of hidden
tragedy in her face which, recalling the beauty of
her dark eyes, rekindled the interest he had felt
in Miriam Ward at their first meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>
<p>His impulse to awaken her was checked by the
thought that she needed the nap&mdash;probably the first
sound sleep that she had had since coming on the
case. It would be cruel to awaken her unnecessarily.
Turning about he tiptoed back into the dining room.
The sound of his name being softly called caused
him to hasten into the living room. Looking up the
staircase he saw Doctor Roberts leaning over the
banisters and beckoning to him. Taking the stairs
two at a time, Alan was by his side in an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked breathlessly. &ldquo;What news?
Have you performed the autopsy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Come into Paul&rsquo;s bedroom,&rdquo; and as he
spoke Roberts led the way across the hall.</p>

<p>Two men were in the bedroom and they both
glanced around at the opening of the door. The
County Coroner, Doctor James Dixon, Alan knew
but slightly; the other, Guy Trenholm, had been his
companion on many a hunting trip in the past.
Trenholm was of giant stature, with the arms and
brawn of the prize ring. There was a certain look
in his gray eyes, however, which indicated power of
mind as well as physical strength. The son of the
town drunkard, Trenholm had spent the first twenty
years of his life doing odd chores for the farmers
thereabouts and gaining a checkered education, finally
acquiring enough money to see him through four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
years at the University of Maryland. He had been
one of the first to enlist upon the entrance of the
United States into the World War and at its close
had returned to Upper Marlboro with an established
record as a &ldquo;first class fighting man.&rdquo; For
nearly a year he had held the office of county sheriff.
He greeted Alan with a silent nod and a handclasp,
the strength of which made the latter wince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mason!&rdquo; exclaimed Coroner Dixon,
hustling forward. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea you were in these
parts again. Your cousin&rsquo;s death is most distressing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a great shock,&rdquo; added Alan soberly. &ldquo;I was
very fond of Paul. We were pals, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understood that you two had quarreled,&rdquo; broke
in Roberts, then observing Alan&rsquo;s frown, he added
hastily: &ldquo;Forgive me, I did not mean to hurt you
by alluding to a painful incident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever my feeling in the past, I can harbor no
resentment now,&rdquo; retorted Alan, his quick temper
ruffled by Roberts&rsquo; mention of an unhappy memory.
&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, what is the result of the autopsy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you asking as a newspaper man or as next
of kin?&rdquo; inquired Coroner Dixon, regarding Alan&rsquo;s
flushed countenance attentively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Paul&rsquo;s cousin,&rdquo; quickly. &ldquo;Whatever you
tell me I will consider strictly confidential.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo;&mdash;Dixon selected a chair&mdash;&ldquo;we
held the autopsy in a spare bedroom at the back of
the house,&rdquo; observing Alan&rsquo;s eyes stray toward the
four-post bedstead, the curtains of which still remained
drawn. &ldquo;The undertaker and his assistants
are there now.&rdquo; He sat back and regarded Alan.
&ldquo;We can consult together here without being disturbed.
As you know, Mr. Abbott had been ill
for several days with an attack of bronchitis and
threatened pneumonia; this, coupled with heart complications,
made his condition very serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did either cause his death?&rdquo; asked Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded the coroner. &ldquo;We probed the
wound in his back and found that the weapon had
penetrated the left lung. In his weakened condition,
death must have been instantaneous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan drew a long breath. &ldquo;So the wound really
was fatal!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The lack of much blood
led me to believe that possibly the weapon had not
struck a vital point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hemorrhage was internal.&rdquo; Coroner Dixon&rsquo;s
expression grew more serious. &ldquo;There is no
doubt, Mason, but that your cousin was murdered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan passed his hand across his eyes. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;
he groaned. &ldquo;Who harbored such animosity against
Paul and how was the murder committed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what we have to find out,&rdquo; cut in Sheriff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Trenholm. &ldquo;Where is the nurse who was with Mr.
Abbott last night, Doctor Roberts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In her room, I presume&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she is asleep downstairs,&rdquo; interrupted Alan
hastily. &ldquo;Shall I call her?&rdquo; A nod from Trenholm
was his only answer, and Alan hurried from the
room, but at the head of the staircase he caught a
glimpse of a white skirt disappearing around the
further corner of the hall and he changed his direction.
He caught up with Miriam Ward just as she
was turning the knob of a closed door, a number of
towels in her left hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wanted by the coroner,&rdquo; he explained,
as she stopped at sight of him.</p>

<p>Miriam grew a shade paler. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she
replied, &ldquo;But first&mdash;&rdquo; she handed the towels to the
undertaker and closed the door again. &ldquo;Where is
the coroner, Mr. Mason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my cousin&rsquo;s old bedroom.&rdquo; Alan suited his
long stride to her shorter one. &ldquo;I hope you feel a
bit rested,&rdquo; glancing down at her with some concern,
but it was doubtful if she heard his remark,
her attention being centered on a figure coming up
the staircase. Alan stopped short as he recognized
the newcomer and his face grew stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She stared at him for a long moment, then without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
a word of any kind she walked by them and
through the bedroom door near which Doctor Roberts
was standing, waiting to greet her. Without
halting Betty made at once for the four-post bedstead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, Betty!&rdquo; Alan had gained her side and
laid a compelling hand on her arm. &ldquo;Paul is not
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty regarded him in utter silence, then faced
about and looked at the small group in the bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul is dead&mdash;dead!&rdquo; she spoke with great difficulty,
one hand plucking always at the collar of her
fur coat. &ldquo;You shall not keep me from him. You&mdash;&rdquo;
for a second her blazing eyes scanned Sheriff Trenholm&mdash;&ldquo;you
dare not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Betty!&rdquo; Roberts took the overwrought
girl&rsquo;s hand in his. &ldquo;You shall see Paul later, dear,
that I promise you. Sit down and calm yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have your word?&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s great eyes never left
Roberts. &ldquo;I shall see Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. There, sit down,&rdquo; as Miriam Ward pulled
forward a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the young lady had better withdraw to
another room,&rdquo; suggested Coroner Dixon. &ldquo;We
are about to start an investigation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An investigation?&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s high-pitched voice,
carrying a warning note of approaching hysteria to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Miriam Ward&rsquo;s watchful ears, reached to the hall
beyond and a figure crouching near the bedroom
door, which had been inadvertently left open a few
inches, leaned forward, the better to catch what
was transpiring in the room. &ldquo;What do you mean,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coroner Dixon contemplated her for a second in
silence. Betty&rsquo;s unusual beauty generally commanded
attention, but something in her expression
focused the Coroner&rsquo;s regard rather than her good
looks, marred as they were by deep circles under
her eyes and haggard lines about her mouth. He
answered her question with another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your name, madam?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;And your relation
to the dead man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Miss Betty Carter,&rdquo; broke in Doctor
Roberts. &ldquo;Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s fiancée.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; Coroner Dixon&rsquo;s interest quickened.
&ldquo;Then Mr. Abbott&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was very dear to me.&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s tone had grown
husky. &ldquo;I must know all about his death.&rdquo; Her
gaze swept Guy Trenholm, standing somewhat in
the background. &ldquo;It is my right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coroner Dixon turned and glanced in doubt at
Trenholm. At the latter&rsquo;s reassuring nod he faced
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Carter,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Since you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
insist I will tell you what we have learned.&rdquo; He
cleared his voice before continuing. &ldquo;Judging by
the condition of the body, Mr. Abbott died between
one-thirty this morning and three o&rsquo;clock. He was
stabbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stabbed!&rdquo; With a convulsive movement Betty
gained her feet, her face deadly white. &ldquo;<i>Stabbed!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Roberts laid a soothing hand on hers.
&ldquo;Be quiet, Betty,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;Or you will have
to go and lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook off his hand. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she directed,
and the urgency of her tone caused Dixon to speak
more rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Abbott was stabbed in the back,&rdquo; he stated.
&ldquo;We know no more than that, at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without taking her gaze from the coroner, Betty
resumed her seat. Then she turned to Roberts. &ldquo;I
heard yesterday that Paul was very ill, and that
you were attending him professionally. Were you
with him last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; until Miss Ward came and then I put her
in charge of the case,&rdquo; replied Roberts. &ldquo;She can
tell you what happened after my departure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam Ward faced their concentrated regard
with outward composure. Caught by chance in the
web of circumstance, she was keenly alive to her
unhappy share in the tragic occurrences of the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
before. Having a high regard for her profession
and throwing her heart and soul into her work she
felt, however little she had been to blame, that the
stigma of neglect of a patient would be laid at her
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before leaving, Doctor Roberts gave me full
instructions,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;And I carried them out.
My chart shows that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your last entry was made shortly after midnight,&rdquo;
pointed out Sheriff Trenholm, picking up
the chart from the table at his elbow. &ldquo;Why was
that, Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was interrupted by the arrival of Miss Carter,&rdquo;
she replied, and the unexpected answer brought a
startled exclamation from three of her companions;
then their gaze left the nurse and centered on Betty.
The latter raised her eyes and regarded the trained
nurse. If chiseled from marble, her white face could
not have been more devoid of human expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; ejaculated Doctor Roberts.
&ldquo;What were you doing here, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl paid not the slightest attention to him;
instead she addressed Miriam, and the others were
startled at her tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on with your story,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Speak
quickly,&rdquo; with a glance at her wrist watch. &ldquo;Time
is passing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carter was accompanied by a clergyman.&rdquo;
Miriam spoke more slowly, weighing her words. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;she
hesitated for a brief moment&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot
recall his name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continue,&rdquo; directed Dixon, as she paused. &ldquo;Did
Miss Carter and her companion see Mr. Abbott?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they did;&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;I feel sure
they did&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you in doubt about it?&rdquo; demanded
Trenholm quickly. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you in the room with
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam shook her head. &ldquo;Not all the time,&rdquo; she
admitted. &ldquo;The clergyman sent me downstairs to
get a lamp as the one in this room had burned
out. When I came back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;what then?&rdquo; Sheriff Trenholm could not
restrain his impatience at her slow speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clergyman had just completed the marriage
service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her words created a sensation. Doctor Roberts&rsquo;
eyes fairly started from his head, and Alan Mason&rsquo;s
excited ejaculation drowned Dixon&rsquo;s more softly
spoken exclamation. Only Guy Trenholm gave no
voice to his feelings. With eyes fixed steadfastly
upon Betty, he remained as emotionless apparently
as she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What transpired next?&rdquo; inquired Dixon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They left,&rdquo; tersely. Miriam&rsquo;s heart was beating
quickly, and her cold fingers were playing a
devil&rsquo;s tattoo on the arm of her chair. Before she
could say more, Betty leaned forward and held up
her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment!&rdquo; She spoke slowly, distinctly.
&ldquo;What were you, a trained nurse, doing when your
patient was stabbed to death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam whitened, but faced her questioner with
quiet courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was lying near the bed unconscious,&rdquo; she admitted,
&ldquo;having been chloroformed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty rose to her feet. &ldquo;I have heard that a
person under the influence of chloroform or ether
is subject to hallucinations,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I prefer to
believe that than to think you are demented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Demented!&rdquo; Miriam sprang up, her eyes flashing
with indignation.</p>

<p>Betty addressed Sheriff Trenholm directly, ignoring
the others. &ldquo;The nurse is either demented
or drawing upon her imagination,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;I was not here last night.&rdquo; She faced Miriam and
her glance was impersonal, unfaltering. &ldquo;Nor have
I ever seen you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">artha Corbin</span> laid down the brass
fire tongs and turned to look at the
wood-basket by the hearth. The logs
were both long and heavy. Before attempting to
lift one her attention was caught by the sound of a
familiar lagging footstep going in the direction
of the back hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Charlie,&rdquo; she called, shrilly. &ldquo;Come &rsquo;ere
and fix this fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A snarl was his only response, and a second later
a door banged shut behind her amiable spouse.
Martha&rsquo;s thin lips compressed into a hard line.
Stooping over she tugged and pulled at the topmost
log and finally lifted it up. She let it fall in the
center of the burning wood and then rested one
hand against the stone chimney to get her breath.
It was some seconds before she felt able to take
up the hearth brush and sweep the ashes back under
the andirons. That successfully accomplished she
dropped on one knee and held her chilled hands
up to the blaze. She was grateful for the heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<p>As she crouched there the firelight, which alone
illuminated the living room at Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, cast
fantastic shadows on her face, exaggerating her
fixed expression to one of almost fierce determination.
Still in her early forties, Martha Corbin had
once been extremely pretty, but ill health had destroyed
her good looks and whitened her hair, which,
worn straight back, intensified the gray pallor of
her appearance.</p>

<p>Her prolonged stare at the fire wavered finally,
caught by a piece of white paper protruding from
a crack in the tiled hearth. One end was singed,
but it had fallen on the outer edge of the bed of
hot ashes and escaped entire destruction. Reaching
down she picked up the piece and turned it over.
It was evidently the upper right-hand corner of an
envelope, for the flap still bore traces of glue as
well as a perfectly formed black seal&mdash;the wax
unbroken except at the edges. Martha had no chance
to read the printed lines on the reverse of the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have ye there?&rdquo; demanded Corbin over
her shoulder and seized her roughly.</p>

<p>With surprising swiftness she broke from his
grasp and got to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bit of torn paper,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;from the
scrap basket, there,&rdquo; touching it with her foot. &ldquo;I
was emptying it in the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t the sheriff say you wasn&rsquo;t to touch
nothing?&rdquo; She met his alarmed look with a timid
shrug of her shoulders. &ldquo;Have ye no sense at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha favored him with a blank stare as she
stood twisting her hands in her apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to build up the fire,&rdquo; she mumbled. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
only an old newspaper and such like rubbish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye hadn&rsquo;t oughter touched it,&rdquo; he growled.
&ldquo;Suppose Sheriff Trenholm or one of his men ask
for the basket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here &rsquo;tis.&rdquo; With a swift glance about
them, she darted over to a chair and taking up a
newspaper lying upon it, crumpled it up and thrust
it into the scrap basket. Hurrying to the mahogany
desk she jerked open one of the drawers and drew
out a bundle of letters and tossed it into the basket
also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a care, Martha!&rdquo; exclaimed Corbin, who
had followed her rapid movements in startled silence.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be a search and everything in
Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge examined by the sheriff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll find the newspaper and the letters in the
scrap basket as easy as if they were on the chair
or in the drawer,&rdquo; she remarked, smiling shrewdly.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t matter <i>where</i> they find &rsquo;em.&rdquo; She
smoothed down the torn hem of her large apron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
and drew closer to her husband. &ldquo;What do ye
&rsquo;spose he done with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; He clapped his scarred hand across her
lips. &ldquo;Hold your tongue, woman. They&rsquo;ll hear,
mebbe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody to hear,&rdquo; she replied tersely, drawing
away from him. &ldquo;Mr. Alan is seeing Coroner Dixon
off and Miss Betty Carter is still upstairs in the
room with <i>him</i>!&rdquo; She shivered. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it <i>awful</i>
the way she&rsquo;s taking on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin nodded, half absently, his eyes intent on
scanning the living room and its staircase at its
other end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surprising, after we know what happened,&rdquo; he
admitted, speaking in little more than a whisper.
&ldquo;But, recollect, Martha, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t up to us to <i>talk</i>.
If ye do&rdquo;&mdash;His look caused her to catch her breath.
&ldquo;Well, ye know what&rsquo;s coming to ye. Ye understand&rdquo;&mdash;and
he seized her arm and turned it until
she winced with pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me be!&rdquo; She winced again as Corbin,
with a final twist, released her arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no
call to handle me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin&rsquo;s only answer was a vicious scowl and
Martha shrank back, one hand to her trembling
lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to speak twice,&rdquo; he commented.
&ldquo;<i>You</i> know me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded dumbly as she retreated behind a
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did ye hear when the nurse was leaving?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>The question went unanswered as Corbin, his attention
attracted by voices on the floor above,
slipped noiselessly down the passageway through
which he had entered some minutes earlier unseen
by his wife. Left to her own devices, Martha
picked up a box of matches and lighted one of the
lamps. She had succeeded in adjusting the wick
when she looked up and caught sight of Betty
Carter regarding her from the lower landing of
the staircase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light the others,&rdquo; Betty directed. &ldquo;All of them&mdash;every
one&rdquo;&mdash;indicating with a wave of her hand
the standing lamp at the foot of the stairs and
several reading lamps placed on small tables near
comfortable lounging chairs where Paul Abbott and
his guests had been wont to pass the long winter
evenings. Betty waited on the stair landing until
her peremptory order had been carried out, then
slowly approached the fireplace. She turned back
on reaching there and addressed Martha.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my coat,&rdquo; she said, extending it. &ldquo;And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
my hat&rdquo;&mdash;She removed it as she spoke. &ldquo;And prepare
a bedroom for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what, Miss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bedroom. I propose staying here to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha gazed at her as if she had not heard
aright. &ldquo;Here, Miss?&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Betty regarded the frightened
woman more attentively. &ldquo;Do as I tell you.&rdquo; Her
sharp tone aroused Martha from her startled contemplation
of her. &ldquo;You can take my hat and coat
upstairs as you go and hang them in the bedroom
closet. Come, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Miss, nothing.&rdquo; Martha reached out
a reluctant hand and took the proffered coat and
hat, then without further word she hastened up the
staircase. So great was her speed that she stumbled
breathlessly into a bedroom halfway down the corridor
of the second floor, the door of which stood
partly open.</p>

<p>Miriam Ward turned at her unceremonious entrance
and regarded her in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, alarmed at the woman&rsquo;s
pallor. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha shook her head as she advanced to the
closet and, opening the door, disappeared inside,
to reappear the next instant, empty-handed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I ain&rsquo;t ill,&rdquo; she volunteered, resting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
one hand on the chair-back. &ldquo;But I think she are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She? Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty Carter.&rdquo; Martha breathed more easily.
&ldquo;She says she is going to stay here all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam stared at the woman. &ldquo;Well, what of
it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she stay if she
wishes to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All by her lonesome and Mr. Paul lying here
dead!&rdquo; Martha&rsquo;s voice of disapproval registered a
higher key than her usual monotone. &ldquo;Who is going
to watch after her? That is,&rdquo; catching herself
up, &ldquo;look after her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Miriam. &ldquo;Are you not
accustomed to doing the housework?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Martha&rsquo;s voice grew more natural.
&ldquo;And Mr. Paul always said I was a prime cook.
Say, Miss Ward, ye ain&rsquo;t going, are ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very shortly, yes.&rdquo; Miriam Ward returned to
the table on which stood her leather bag which she
had been packing when interrupted by Martha, and
laid in it her neatly folded white uniform. The metal
case containing hypodermic syringe, thermometer,
and small phials of stimulants was next tucked
carefully inside, and then Miriam closed and locked
the bag. &ldquo;Have you seen Doctor Roberts recently?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha shook her head. &ldquo;He is still about the
place with Mr. Alan,&rdquo; she responded. She cocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
an inquisitive eye at Miriam and took in appraisingly
her trim, well-cut wool house gown. She had
a dim, preconceived notion that all nurses were
dowdy, and to find Miriam a becomingly dressed,
extremely pretty, well-bred young woman was a distinct
novelty. &ldquo;Are ye going into Washington with
Doctor Roberts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He asked me to wait for him.&rdquo; Miriam
was conscious of a feeling of repulsion under the
steady stare of Martha&rsquo;s oddly matched eyes&mdash;the
iris of one was a pale blue, while the other was a
deep brown. &ldquo;I have not slept in the bed, Martha;
so it is not necessary for you to remake it&rdquo;&mdash;as the
housekeeper laid her hand on the white counterpane.
&ldquo;But perhaps it would be just as well to have your
husband bring up more wood. The room is a trifle
chilly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some in the wood box in the hall; I&rsquo;ll
get it&rdquo;&mdash;and before Miriam could utter a remonstrance,
Martha had hurried away. She was back
again in an instant, her arms full of small blocks
of cord wood. Not waiting for Miriam&rsquo;s quickly
proffered assistance, she let them fall clumsily on
the hearth, and then gazed aghast at a long rent
in her apron in which still hung a sliver of wood.
Her name, called with loud insistence in her husband&rsquo;s
unmistakable accents, caused her to start<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
violently. Pausing only long enough to untie her
apron and toss it aside, she hurried from the room,
jostling Miriam in her haste to be gone.</p>

<p>Miriam stood in thought for a few seconds, then
moved over to the pier glass and put on her hat.
She regretted having accepted Doctor Roberts&rsquo; invitation
to drive to the city with him. Had she
followed her own inclination, she would have ordered
a taxicab immediately after her scene with
Betty Carter and departed. But, confused by Betty&rsquo;s,
to her, incomprehensible behavior, she had listened
to Coroner Dixon&rsquo;s urgent request that she
remain a few hours longer at Abbott&rsquo;s lodge, until,
as he expressed it, Betty had had time to pull herself
together. Coroner Dixon hinted that hysteria explained
her conduct. Miriam&rsquo;s expression grew more
thoughtful. The shock of finding her lover dead
might account for much, but was that <i>alone</i> responsible
for Betty&rsquo;s denial of her midnight visit to
Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge?</p>

<p>Sheriff Trenholm had summed up the situation in
one brief sentence&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one girl&rsquo;s word against
the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she, &ldquo;the other girl,&rdquo; was unknown and without
money, while Betty had hosts of friends and
an assured position in the world!</p>

<p>If she could only recall the name of the clergyman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
who had accompanied Betty! He would substantiate
her statement. But try as she did to clearly
remember each event of the night, his name eluded
her. Undoubtedly the chloroform, with which she
had been anesthetized, had much to do with her loss
of memory. With proper rest, its effects would undoubtedly
wear off; until then&mdash;</p>

<p>Miriam fingered the string of blue beads, which
she was wearing, nervously. Neither Coroner Dixon
nor Sheriff Trenholm had given her an inkling as
to whether they really placed faith in her statement.
They had listened with deep interest and without
comment. In the face of their silence, she had
hesitated to tell them of finding a strange man and
not her patient in Abbott&rsquo;s bed just before she lost
consciousness. With no proof to offer them, she
feared the hard-headed Sheriff would consider her
demented indeed.</p>

<p>Turning from the mirror, Miriam walked across
the bedroom toward the chair on which she had
laid her coat and inadvertently trod on Martha&rsquo;s
discarded apron. As she lifted it up, intending to
put it on the chair, a piece of paper rolled out of a
rip in the hem of the apron and fell at her feet.
Instinctively Miriam stooped over and picked up
the paper, but instead of laying it down on top of
the apron, she continued to hold it in front of her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
her eyes caught by a black seal. The wax impression
of the crest was distinct and unmistakable.
With a sharp intake of her breath, Miriam turned
over the half burned envelope. The Canadian postage
was intact, but the name of the person to whom
the envelope had been addressed was entirely burned
away.</p>

<p>Miriam continued to regard the piece of envelope
with fixed intentness. Slowly she deciphered the
blurred postmark&mdash;it bore a recent date, of that she
was positive&mdash;but then, how came the black crest
upon any letter? Who dared to use it? Miriam was
conscious of a feeling of icy coldness not due to the
temperature of the room.</p>

<p>An authoritative tap on her door brought the red
blood to her white cheeks with a rush and as Alan
Mason looked inside the room at her low-voiced,
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he was struck by her air of distinction
and the direct gaze of her hazel eyes, which were
her chief beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Roberts is about to leave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let
me carry your bag,&rdquo; as she made a motion toward
it, &ldquo;and your coat.&rdquo; Not listening to her murmured
protest, he gathered up her things and waited for
her to precede him through the doorway.</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s hesitation was imperceptible. Opening
her handbag she dropped the half burned envelope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
inside it, then composedly walked down the corridor.
At the head of the staircase she paused and
addressed her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they made any plans for the funeral?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is postponed until after the preliminary hearing
of the inquest,&rdquo; Alan replied, keeping his voice
lowered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And has that been called?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded. &ldquo;For to-morrow morning, I understand.
There is some technicality which is causing
unexpected delay.&rdquo; They were almost at the bottom
of the stairs when he caught sight of Betty Carter
standing in front of the fireplace talking to Doctor
Roberts. Alan ceased speaking with such abruptness
that he drew an inquiring glance from Miriam,
of which he was totally unaware. Doctor Roberts
gave her no time for thought, however. Coming
hastily forward, he reached her side in time to help
her on with her coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have kept you waiting,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But there were certain matters.... Bless my soul,
Alan, more reporters!&rdquo; as the gong over the front
door sounded with startling suddenness. &ldquo;Betty, my
dear,&rdquo; turning to address the silent girl by the fireplace,
&ldquo;you had better disappear if you don&rsquo;t wish
to be interviewed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see them; don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; exclaimed Alan, as
he swung open the front door. But instead of the
anticipated reporters, he was confronted by a small
familiar figure bundled up in expensive furs. &ldquo;Mrs.
Nash!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; Mrs. Nash lowered the high collar
of her coat as she came further into the living
room, and collapsed in the nearest chair. &ldquo;Let me
get my breath. Dear me, I&rsquo;m half frozen!&rdquo; and
she chafed one cold hand over the other. &ldquo;Come
here, Betty, and help me off with these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Dora!&rdquo; Betty hastened to her side.
&ldquo;How imprudent of you to come all the way out
here! You will surely be ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Nash,
through chattering teeth. &ldquo;I got out of a sick bed to
come here, and Pierre, the wretch, ran out of gasoline
a mile away and I had to walk through the snow
or sit in the car and freeze to death. Good gracious,
Alan! don&rsquo;t stand there looking at me; get me something
warm to drink. I am having a chill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hot water bag, also,&rdquo; added Doctor Roberts,
hastening to her assistance as Mrs. Nash struggled
out of her coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can find whisky more easily than the latter,&rdquo;
answered Alan, and sped for the dining room. Miriam
Ward was close behind him and helped him pour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
out a generous allowance from the carefully concealed
decanter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw a hot water bag hanging in your cousin&rsquo;s
bathroom,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will get it and have it
filled if you will give this stimulant to Mrs. Nash.&rdquo;
She paused by the door. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s husband
a clergyman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo; glancing keenly at her flushed
cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;that is,&rdquo; avoiding his gaze. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
keep Mrs. Nash waiting,&rdquo; as she hurried away with a
fast beating heart. She had recalled the name of
Betty&rsquo;s companion on her midnight visit to Paul
Abbott&mdash;Doctor Nash.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash accepted the proffered whisky with
relief. &ldquo;I need a bracer,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Indeed,
Betty, the shocking news of poor Paul&rsquo;s untimely
death bowled me over; and then to be told that you
had raced out here in a hired taxi, without either
your uncle or me,&mdash;it&mdash;it&mdash;took my breath away.&rdquo;
A shiver which she could not check shook her from
head to foot and Doctor Roberts helped her to a
couch, while Betty brought a heavy laprobe and
threw it over her aunt. As she turned away Mrs.
Nash caught Doctor Roberts&rsquo; coat sleeve and motioned
to him to bend down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it really true,&rdquo; she questioned him in a whisper,
&ldquo;that Paul has been murdered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Hush, no details now,&rdquo; as Miriam approached
the couch. He addressed her in his customary
tone of voice. &ldquo;Ah, a hot water bag; just
the thing. You are fortunate, Mrs. Nash, in having
a trained nurse right here at your elbow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s piercing black eyes
took in Miriam&rsquo;s appearance in a pronounced stare.
She permitted Miriam to make herself more comfortable,
before addressing her again. &ldquo;Have you
been nursing Mr. Abbott?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Miriam stepped back from the couch and
turned to Doctor Roberts. &ldquo;I think I had better
telephone for a taxi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my aunt can return to Washington with
you,&rdquo; broke in Betty Carter as she joined the small group.
&ldquo;It will be an excellent arrangement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I make my own plans, thank you,&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
Nash, whose high color betokened a touch of temper.
&ldquo;Do you suppose that with this attack of flu I can
venture out of doors again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you propose to spend
the night here?&rdquo; asked Alan, returning in time to
hear her last remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. My husband and I have been frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
visitors, and I know there are plenty of
bedrooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Aunt, suppose you get sick?&rdquo;
Betty gazed at her in utter disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sick already,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Nash. &ldquo;Chills
and fever&mdash;where&rsquo;s your thermometer, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts looked grave as he prepared the small
instrument for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your niece is right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This country
place is isolated from Washington in winter, and
with illness&mdash;&rdquo; he paused to put the thermometer
in Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s mouth; then he addressed Betty. &ldquo;I
think you also had better change your plan, and
return to Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the best judge of what I should do,&rdquo; she
huffed and turned away. Roberts eyed her in speculative
silence as he took out his fountain pen and
wrote a prescription.</p>

<p>Alan, who had been watching Betty also, turned
to Miriam. &ldquo;Where can the coroner reach you?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;You have not given me your address?
Or let me have your bill?&rdquo; he added, lowering his
voice to a confidential pitch.</p>

<p>Miriam colored warmly; the commercial side of
her profession always embarrassed her. &ldquo;I was engaged
for an eighteen-hour duty,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;I
suppose the charge is seven dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<p>Alan drew out his wallet and pressed some bills
into her hand. &ldquo;And your address?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can always reach me through Central Registry,&rdquo;
and with a nod of gratitude she passed him to
go to the telephone.</p>

<p>From her couch, Mrs. Nash watched her opportunity.
With a gesture of surprising quickness she
removed the thermometer from her mouth and
tucked it unseen against the hot water bottle. When
Doctor Roberts closed his notebook and turned
back to her, the thermometer was once again held
firmly between her lips. He took it out, looked
at it twice, and then at Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s scarlet countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Ward,&rdquo; he called, and his voice was grave.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t order a taxi&mdash;I think that you had better
remain and prepare a bedroom for Mrs. Nash,&rdquo;
and then, in an undertone, as Miriam gained his
side, &ldquo;it will never do to take Mrs. Nash out in this
weather&mdash;her temperature reads 103°.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="reduce">SHERIFF TRENHOLM ASKS QUESTIONS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>&nbsp;<span class="smcap">distinct</span> and unmistakable snore from the
bed caused Miriam to approach her patient.
Mrs. Nash, her head unevenly balanced between
two pillows, was at last asleep. To place her
in a more comfortable position would undoubtedly
awaken her, and Miriam backed away on tiptoe from
the bedside. She had spent three weary hours at
Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s beck and call; she had run every conceivable
errand the sick woman&rsquo;s fancy had dictated,
had prepared her for bed, and finally induced
her, on threat of departure, to swallow the medicine
prescribed by Doctor Roberts.</p>

<p>Martha&rsquo;s scanty wardrobe could not provide clothing
for Mrs. Nash, and the housekeeper had been
dispatched to Upper Marlboro, the county seat, in
the Nash limousine which had finally put in an
appearance, to purchase such necessities as the country
stores could supply. Betty Carter had taken little
part in the discussion, contenting herself with the
request that Martha buy a wrapper, bedroom slippers,
and a night dress and bring them at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
to her room, whereupon she had gone upstairs and
locked her door. Martha had carried her dinner to
her upon her return from the shopping expedition.</p>

<p>Miriam had been too intent upon her professional
duties to pay much attention to the other members
of the small party, but she had gathered from
Martha&rsquo;s remarks that Alan Mason and Doctor
Roberts had left for Upper Marlboro in the latter&rsquo;s
car shortly after dinner. Martha, with a sidelong
glance which Miriam was beginning to associate
with the housekeeper&rsquo;s personality, had overheard
Alan tell her husband that he would return in time
to &ldquo;sit up with Mr. Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it awful, Ma&rsquo;am&mdash;Miss, to think of that
poor gentleman lying in t&rsquo;other room dead,&rdquo; she
went on, with a shiver. &ldquo;And him so sot on getting
well. Poor Mr. Paul!&rdquo; And she wiped away a few
tears with the hem of her clean apron. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
rest easy in his grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The housekeeper&rsquo;s words recurred to Miriam as
her gaze, which had been wandering about the room,
rested on a small, black-bordered sketch of what
appeared to be a group of neglected graves. The
picture was well executed, but Miriam wondered at
its selection for a decoration in a bedroom. From
the drawing Miriam&rsquo;s eyes wandered to several paintings
on the wall, and, from the likeness of one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the portraits to Paul Abbott, she judged it to be
that of his father. Evidently the room given to
Mrs. Nash had once been occupied by the elder
Abbott, whether as bedroom or sitting room was
hard to say, for the remainder of the pictures on the
wall were hunting scenes and, except for the bedstead,
the rest of the furniture was such as is found
in a man&rsquo;s &ldquo;den.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam selected the most comfortable of the easy-chairs
and, taking care to make no noise, pushed it
around so that from its depths she could have an
unobstructed view of her patient. Her fatigued muscles
relaxed as she sank back in the chair, but her brain&mdash;ah,
it was on fire! For a moment she looked with
envy at the slumbering woman. If she could only
sleep as soundly with no visions of the past to
disturb her! The present was bad enough in all
conscience&mdash;who could have murdered Paul Abbott
and what possible motive could have inspired the
crime?</p>

<p>The cautious turning of the door knob and the
slow opening of the door caused her to bend forward
in her chair. Sheriff Trenholm leaned inside the
door and, catching sight of Miriam, raised a beckoning
finger, and then placed it against his lips,
enjoining silence.</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s rubber-soled shoes made no noise on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the hardwood floor and she gained the hall door without
disturbing her patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, stepping partly into the
hall, down which the sheriff had retreated a few
paces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a talk with you,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Just quietly, by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my patient!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is asleep, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo; She came further into the hall so
as to speak more emphatically and yet not awaken
Mrs. Nash. &ldquo;I am on night duty. I cannot leave
my patient alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to; Mrs. Corbin will stay with
her, and call you if there is the slightest need for
your presence.&rdquo; Sheriff Trenholm moved to one
side and Miriam caught a glimpse beyond him of
Martha loitering by the door to Paul Abbott&rsquo;s old
bedroom. &ldquo;Come, Miss Ward, you will only be
across the corridor from Mrs. Nash; and it is
essential that I see you to-night.&ldquo; His voice deepened
and his hand, as if by accident, pulled back his
coat so that the badge of authority on his vest was
visible. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll relieve you of any responsibility should
Mrs. Nash question your absence,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Go
in, Mrs. Corbin,&rdquo; as the housekeeper, who had
drawn nearer, paused undecidedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Miriam stepped back into the bedroom. Mrs.
Nash was still asleep&mdash;there was really nothing left
for her to do but obey the sheriff. She turned to
Martha, standing timidly half in and half out of the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit over in that chair,&rdquo; she directed softly, indicating
the one she had occupied a moment before.
&ldquo;If Mrs. Nash grows restless in her sleep or wakens,
come at once for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am&mdash;Miss.&rdquo; Martha found it difficult
to decide on her mode of address so far as the
nurse was concerned, and compromised the matter
by jumbling the titles together. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye be
afeared; I&rsquo;ll call ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriff Trenholm was standing in the center of
Abbott&rsquo;s old bedroom staring at the windows, the
curtains of which were drawn. He turned around
at Miriam&rsquo;s entrance and, stepping behind her, closed
the hall door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish our talk to be interrupted,&rdquo; he said
by way of explanation. &ldquo;Now, Miss Ward, exactly
what occurred here last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam studied the man in front of her in silence.
There was something big and fine about Guy Trenholm&mdash;an
air of candor, of strength&mdash;that impressed
her, but an inborn caution, a streak inherited from
some dour Scottish ancestor, kept back the words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
on her tongue. Suppose the sheriff was setting a
trap for her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will I be called as a witness at the inquest?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why question me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His smile was friendly as he pulled forward a
chair and stood resting one hand on it. &ldquo;The inquest
may be delayed a few days,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;There is a conflict of authority as to jurisdiction&rdquo;&mdash;he
paused, then added more briskly: &ldquo;Is the furniture
in this room placed as it was last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam stared about her before answering. &ldquo;It
is just the same,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the windows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two were open.&rdquo; She crossed the room and
laid her hand on a tall mahogany screen. &ldquo;I placed
this here so that the air would not blow directly on
Mr. Abbott and arranged the curtains at that window
so as to protect him also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm walked by her and, raising the window
nearest the four-post bedstead, looked outside. &ldquo;It
gives on the roof of the verandah,&rdquo; he said, drawing
in his head. &ldquo;An easy climb from the ground for an
agile man. It is a reasonable hypothesis that the
murderer gained entrance that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he have left tracks in the snow?&rdquo; she
broke in quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He probably did, but there was a second fall of
snow about five this morning which obliterated all
marks.&rdquo; The sheriff closed the window. &ldquo;This
screen made an admirable hiding place, I have no
doubt. He probably sprang from behind it and
chloroformed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam shivered. &ldquo;When I came to myself this
morning I was lying just about here&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed
with her foot to a spot midway between the bed
and the screen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you detected no sound&mdash;no odd noises when
the murderer entered the room?&rdquo; questioned Trenholm
and his gaze never left her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard nothing to make me suspect that any one
was in the room except Mr. Abbott and me,&rdquo; she
stated. &ldquo;You recollect that I was absent several
times; once when I went downstairs to admit Miss
Betty Carter and her companion,&rdquo; she hesitated.
&ldquo;And when I went to the head of the staircase at
their departure.&rdquo; Again she hesitated. &ldquo;I also left
the room on an errand while they were here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm eyed her oddly. &ldquo;What was the errand
and who sent you on it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lamp went out and the clergyman asked me
to get one from downstairs,&rdquo; she explained, tersely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>
<p>He considered her statements for several moments,
then nodded his head thoughtfully. &ldquo;The man probably
selected one of the times when Paul was left
alone&mdash;preferably the last occasion, for then there
was less danger of detection. You were chloroformed
immediately upon your return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes. I lost consciousness&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Her hesitation
caught his attention. &ldquo;It is all very confused;
I cannot think clearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brace up!&rdquo; His tone, though kindly, was firm,
and Miriam checked her inclination to cry&mdash;she was
utterly weary and her head ached with memories
which would not down. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he added as she
bit her lip and winked back the tears. &ldquo;Are you
positive you heard no one talking to Mr. Abbott?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except Miss Carter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, aside from her,&rdquo; with patient persistence.</p>

<p>Miriam shook her head. &ldquo;I can swear that I
heard no one converse with Mr. Abbott except Doctor
Roberts and Miss Carter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no murmur of voices as you lost
consciousness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; mused Trenholm. &ldquo;Why did not Paul
Abbott cry out when you were chloroformed? He
was conscious last night&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, although occasionally irrational.&rdquo; She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
glanced up at the sheriff and then toward the bed.
&ldquo;Possibly he was killed before I returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be.&rdquo; Trenholm tugged at his mustache.
&ldquo;Was Mr. Abbott in a condition to get up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might have, with assistance,&rdquo; cautiously.</p>

<p>He regarded her in silence, then nodded his head.
&ldquo;That is what Doctor Roberts told me.&rdquo; Again he
stroked his mustache. &ldquo;Have you examined the bed
since the body was removed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then look here.&rdquo; He walked with her to the
four-post bedstead and drew aside the curtains.
The blankets and top sheet were neatly pulled back,
leaving exposed the under sheet, while the pillows
lay as Miriam had last seen them. &ldquo;Do you notice
that there are no marks of blood, except this small
stain,&rdquo; motioning toward a spot near the head of
the bed.</p>

<p>Miriam bent over the bedclothes and then looked
up at the sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found Mr. Abbott lying partly on his left
side&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t stabbed in that position,&rdquo; declared
Trenholm vehemently. &ldquo;It would have been a physical
impossibility&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless the murderer stood facing him as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
lay in bed and, reaching over Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s shoulder,
stabbed him in the back,&rdquo; suggested Miriam.</p>

<p>Trenholm looked doubtful. &ldquo;That is possible but
not probable,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;And it is not borne
out by facts. If he was killed in bed, the sheets
would have been stained with blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His remark was caught by Alan Mason as the
latter stepped inside the bedroom. At the sound of
his entrance, Trenholm wheeled around and his
frown at the interruption gave place to a pleased
smile. Alan bowed to Miriam before addressing the
sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coroner Dixon told me that the wound bled
internally,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that explain
the comparatively stainless condition of the sheets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to my way of thinking,&rdquo; declared the sheriff.
He frowned again. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe Paul was
killed in that bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that the murderer lifted Paul out
of bed, killed him, and then put him back in bed?&rdquo;
Alan smiled in derision as he put the question.
&ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;s absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Miriam drew a step nearer Alan. His
presence gave her courage. There was something
indefinable about Alan Mason which, for want of a
better word, she recognized as caste. His consideration
in having a dinner tray sent to Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
door had kept her from a supperless vigil in the
sick room and it was but one of many small acts
of courtesy. &ldquo;There is something I must tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes? Go on, Miss Ward.&rdquo; Sheriff Trenholm
brought her a chair. &ldquo;Sit down, you must be worn
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mechanically she seated herself. &ldquo;I wanted to tell
you this afternoon,&ldquo; she continued, struggling to
steady her voice. She felt strangely nervous. Surely
the curtains of the four-post bedstead were moving?
She looked hard at them, then averted her gaze.
Pshaw, nerves must not get the best of her. &ldquo;But
Miss Carter insisted that I was demented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan changed his weight from one foot to the
other as he leaned against the table. &ldquo;Miss Carter
appeared hardly accountable for her behavior,&rdquo; he
began. &ldquo;I think that we can safely say that, eh,
Guy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriff Trenholm did not at once reply. With
head bent he studied the pattern of the rug upon
which they were standing, and when he looked up
his expression was inscrutable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Carter will be questioned further,&rdquo; he said
noncommittally. &ldquo;Go ahead, Miss Ward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam Ward moistened her dry lips. Would
they believe her, or would she simply involve herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
more deeply in the mystery by making statements
which she could not prove?</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I came back after Miss Carter&rsquo;s departure
with her companion,&rdquo; she spoke slowly, almost
haltingly, and to one of the men watching her, she
appeared more like an animated waxen figure than a
human being, &ldquo;I put down the lamp and walked
over to this bed. The curtains were adjusted about
as they are now.&rdquo; Miriam paused and pointed toward
them. &ldquo;I drew them aside and looked down&mdash;a
strange man lay in the bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one accord the two men advanced to her
side. &ldquo;Where was Paul?&rdquo; demanded Alan and the
sheriff almost in the same breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Miriam. &ldquo;The shock
of not seeing my patient was so great I felt myself
reeling backwards&mdash;and knew no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guy Trenholm and Alan exchanged glances.
&ldquo;And the murderer&rsquo;s confederate seized that moment
to chloroform you!&rdquo; ejaculated Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confederate? You are traveling fast, Alan, my
boy,&rdquo; exclaimed Trenholm. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t the man
in the bed have sprung up as Miss Ward toppled
over and chloroformed her as she lay on the floor
in a fainting condition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is possible,&rdquo; agreed Alan. &ldquo;What did the
man look like, Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>
<p>Miriam&rsquo;s gaze shifted dumbly from one to the
other of her companions. She had dreaded the question.
&ldquo;His eyes were closed and except that he wore
a beard and his hair was dark, I cannot tell you
what he looked like,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;The room
was dimly lighted. I saw the man but for an instant,
and then lost consciousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sheriff Trenholm regarded her in steadfast
silence. It was Alan who broke the prolonged pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you know the man if you saw him
again?&rdquo; he asked and Miriam was grateful that no
note of doubt had crept into his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I would,&rdquo; she answered swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; Alan&rsquo;s smile was very engaging.
His eyes swept a searching glance about
the big bedroom. &ldquo;How was the man dressed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam shook her head. &ldquo;I have no idea. The
bedclothes were pulled up about his shoulders to
his chin.&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;I only caught a glimpse
of his profile.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> minutes dragged interminably to
Martha Corbin and she wished most devoutly
that she had gone to her room before
Guy Trenholm had found her in the kitchen. The
sheriff was not a man to disobey, and at his peremptory
direction she had at once accompanied him
upstairs to find Miriam Ward. But she had not
bargained on having to take the nurse&rsquo;s place in
Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom. Illness in any form terrified
her, and only the knowledge that Miriam was across
the hall kept her in her chair. At first she had not
been uncomfortable, but as Miriam&rsquo;s absence grew
prolonged, the housekeeper found it impossible to
keep still. Her twitching fingers fumbled with the
arms of the tufted chair until she had loosened four
or five upholstery buttons and pulled off several
inches of braid. Bouncing to her feet she looked
at Mrs. Nash, then, convinced that she was still
asleep, she tiptoed over to the old-fashioned bureau
at the opposite end of the room.</p>

<p>Martha studied her reflection in the mirror above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the bureau for fully five minutes. Displeased with
her slovenly appearance, she let down her hair and,
picking up the comb and hair-brush which Miriam
had loaned to Mrs. Nash earlier in the evening, she
tried several ways of dressing her hair. Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
gold vanity case next attracted her attention and at
least ten minutes were consumed in applying first
rouge and then powder. Finally she stood back to
note the effect upon her complexion. A slow smile
of satisfaction stole across her face, and, without
the slightest compunction, she transferred a large
gob of the rouge to a piece of tissue paper and,
folding it many times, stuffed it inside her dress,
for future use.</p>

<p>Tiring of staring at her own countenance, Martha
went over to a large bow window and, leaning on
the ledge, peered out into the darkness. Familiar
as she was with the location of the bedroom, she
knew the direction in which she was gazing, but it
was impossible for her to distinguish even an outline
of the large modern garage which had been
built in the rear of the house some years previously.
Corbin had told her that he would return from a trip
to Upper Marlboro before ten o&rsquo;clock, but that she
was not to wait up for him as he would occupy
one of the servants&rsquo; bedrooms in the garage, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
other having been prepared for Pierre, Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
chauffeur.</p>

<p>The weather had moderated with the suddenness
which characterizes the disconcerting alterations in
temperature in the vicinity of the District of Columbia
and southern Maryland. The drip, drip, drip
of the thawing snow on the eaves of the house came
distinctly to Martha through the half-open window,
while the heavy mist, rising from the Patuxent River,
on the banks of which the estate of Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge
bordered, but made the outer darkness more impenetrable.</p>

<p>With a slight shiver, Martha faced about, thankful
for the companionable warmth of the carefully
shaded light in the bedroom. It was no night for
any one to be out, and for the matter of that, it
was time that a hard-working woman was allowed
to go to bed. Martha&rsquo;s lips quivered as her grievance
increased in importance the more she dwelt upon
it. Was she never to be considered? Well, she
would go. What was Mrs. Nash to her? The master
was dead&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name, pronounced with startling distinctness
by Mrs. Nash, caused Martha to clutch the window
curtains in sudden fright. In the silence that followed
she gathered courage to draw closer to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
bed. Mrs. Nash lay with eyes tightly closed and
Martha judged from her slow and regular breathing
that she was still asleep. A hasty glance about the
room convinced her that she and Mrs. Nash were
alone. Martha crossed herself devoutly just as the
sick woman spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul, can you hear me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Martha&rsquo;s shaking knees carried her only a few
inches from the bed, and then curiosity overcame
her terror. Mrs. Nash was talking in her sleep.
With extreme caution she got down on her hands
and knees and crept to the side of the bed. For
fully fifteen minutes she crouched there, but Mrs.
Nash did not speak again. Slowly and with great
pains Martha straightened up sufficiently to get a
good look at Mrs. Nash. She had not altered her
position and lay with eyes still closed. With the
determination of a weak and obstinate nature,
Martha decided to remain where she was, and cast
about for a satisfactory explanation of her position
by the bed should Miriam Ward return. She was
laboriously thinking one up when her eyes were
attracted by the constant movement of a hand on the
pillow. Martha wished most heartily that Mrs. Nash
would keep still, and she almost gave tongue to her
thoughts; but speech was arrested by the sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
realization that both of Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s hands lay perfectly
quiet on the counterpane.</p>

<p>With eyes distended to twice their natural size,
Martha watched the third hand slip under the pillow
and then out again. As it approached the throat of
the sleeping woman, she saw clearly the long, sensitive
fingers and the heavy signet ring&mdash;</p>

<p>Martha&rsquo;s frayed nerves gave way. Her mouth
dropped open and sheer terror gave strength to the
shriek which broke from her. When Miriam raced
into the room she found her a crumpled, unconscious
heap in the center of the floor and Mrs. Nash sitting
up in bed regarding her with ashen face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she dead?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; just a faint.&rdquo; Miriam&rsquo;s calm tones belied
her feelings; she was almost as startled as Mrs.
Nash. &ldquo;Please lie down again, Mrs. Nash, and keep
yourself covered; otherwise you will take cold.&rdquo; She
paused by the bedside long enough to pull up the
bedclothes and make Mrs. Nash comfortable, then
hurried to her emergency kit and from it took a
little aromatic spirits of ammonia. Martha revived
quickly under the restorative. Later she staggered
to her feet and, with Miriam&rsquo;s assistance, took a
few halting steps toward the hall door. She stopped
abruptly on the threshold at sight of Sheriff Trenholm
and Alan waiting anxiously in the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked Trenholm. &ldquo;Is Mrs.
Nash worse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Miriam. &ldquo;I am not sure what
occurred. Martha refuses to tell me. Perhaps if
you question her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt fainty, like,&rdquo; broke in Martha with marked
haste. She avoided looking at the two men. &ldquo;Please,
Miss&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am, take me to my room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm read Miriam&rsquo;s hesitation aright. &ldquo;Go
and stay with Mrs. Nash, Alan,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;until
Miss Ward returns. Now, Martha,&rdquo; and before the
startled housekeeper could protest, he picked her up
in his arms and started down the hall. Pausing only
long enough to take a bottle of medicine and a glass,
Miriam hurried after the sheriff, as Alan went in to
speak to Mrs. Nash.</p>

<p>The suite of rooms, comprising sitting room, bedroom
and bath, which Corbin and his wife occupied,
was at one end of the winding corridor and off a
landing halfway up a flight of steps leading to the
garret. Miriam took note of the comfortable furniture
in the bedroom as she assisted Martha out of
her clothes and into bed. The housekeeper was
taciturn to the point of sullenness, and Miriam finally
forbore to address her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink this,&rdquo; she handed a glass to Martha as she
spoke. &ldquo;It is a harmless sedative; don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
observing the woman&rsquo;s expression. &ldquo;You will feel
better in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it make me sleep?&rdquo; asked Martha, huddling
down under the blankets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Miriam halted by the door. &ldquo;Is there anything
more I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Martha remembered her manners and her
face emerged from under the blankets. &ldquo;Thank you,
Ma&rsquo;am&mdash;Miss. Jest blow out the lamp as you go
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam hesitated. &ldquo;You are not afraid to stay
in the dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ma&rsquo;am&mdash;Miss. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam echoed the words as she carried out
Martha&rsquo;s wishes, then closing the door softly she
went thoughtfully down the corridor. She had almost
reached Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s door when Trenholm
called her name softly and joined her a moment
later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you learn anything from the housekeeper?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Martha hardly spoke.&rdquo;
Miriam paused. &ldquo;Her condition may be due to
hysteria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm studied her expression. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t
think so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>
<p>She looked straight at him. &ldquo;No. I believe the
woman was almost paralyzed with fright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm remained silent for a few seconds, then
roused himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope Mrs. Nash
suffers no ill effects from her rude awakening. A
moment, Miss Ward,&rdquo; as Miriam laid her hand
on Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom door. &ldquo;Please tell Mr.
Mason that I will remain with Abbott&rsquo;s body. If
you,&rdquo; he lowered his voice almost to a whisper, &ldquo;if
you need me, you will find me there,&rdquo; and turning
he went down the corridor.</p>

<p>Alan Mason rose at Miriam&rsquo;s approach and relinquished
his seat by the bedside, with a relieved air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Nash <i>will</i> talk,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;although I
tried to monopolize the conversation in the hope of
making her sleepy. Is there anything more I can
do?&rdquo; His question was intended for Miriam but
Mrs. Nash answered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Close the door behind you,&rdquo; she said tartly, and
Alan colored as he met Miriam&rsquo;s dark eyes, with a
faint quizzical gleam in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheriff Trenholm is with the body,&rdquo; she murmured,
as he passed her on his way out of the room.
&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Nash, raising
herself on her elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Miriam bent over her and straightened the pillows
with a practiced hand. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that more comfortable?&rdquo;
she asked, as Mrs. Nash sank back with a
sigh. &ldquo;It is time for your medicine,&rdquo; glancing, as
she spoke, at her wrist watch. &ldquo;Just a second,&rdquo; and
moving swiftly over to the table, she prepared it
and then returned to the bed. She expected some
difficulty in persuading Mrs. Nash to take it, but to
her secret surprise the latter swallowed it without a
murmur, but with a wry face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberts never prescribed an agreeable dose,&rdquo; she
commented, after sipping a glass of water. &ldquo;Sit by
me, Miss Ward, I want to ask you some questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; Miriam&rsquo;s charming smile softened
her refusal. &ldquo;You must go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With that howl still ringing in my ears!&rdquo; Mrs.
Nash&rsquo;s shudder was no affectation, but a true indication
of her state of mind. &ldquo;What possessed the
woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hysterics,&rdquo; briefly. &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Nash, you
really must close your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a minute. Sit down just a second.&rdquo; Mrs.
Nash&rsquo;s tone could be coaxing when she wished.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever you say if you will answer a few
questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be obstinate.&rdquo; Mrs. Nash glanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
at her shrewdly. &ldquo;If you irritate me, I&rsquo;ll not sleep
at all,&rdquo; and she squared her shoulders with an air
of determination which made Miriam&rsquo;s heart sink.
She knew, none better, that often temper and temperature
went hand and hand in the sick room.
Humoring a patient was occasionally a short cut to
health as well as peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it you wish to know?&rdquo; she asked, sitting
down.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash smiled, well pleased with having gained
her point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What killed Paul?&rdquo; she asked, and at Miriam&rsquo;s
frown, added hastily: &ldquo;There is nothing in that
question to send my temperature skyward. Was he
poisoned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; stabbed.&rdquo; Miriam met her piercing black
eyes steadily, while wondering at the concentration
of her regard. Mrs. Nash sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the knife left in the body?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they found it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Miriam hastened to supplement her second
monosyllable with a further statement as she
saw another question trembling on Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
lips. &ldquo;The weapon has not been found <i>yet</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how do they know that he was stabbed?&rdquo;
persisted Mrs. Nash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By the nature of the wound,&rdquo; replied Miriam.
&ldquo;Sheriff Trenholm told me just now that the autopsy
proved Mr. Abbott died from what is known as a
punctured wound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is that precisely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the weapon used left a fusiform or spindle-shaped
wound,&rdquo; she added, observing Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
blank expression. &ldquo;Now, please lie down again, for
that is the last question I am going to answer to-night,&rdquo;
and the gentle firmness of her voice convinced
Mrs. Nash that she meant what she said.
But before she settled back on the pillows she looked
around at her nurse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was my niece talking to Guy Trenholm in the
hall before you came in here a second time?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>

<p>Miriam shook her head in the negative. &ldquo;Not to
my knowledge. I have not seen Miss Carter since
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash grunted as she turned over on her side.
&ldquo;Well, if Betty slept through Martha&rsquo;s dreadful
scream she rivals the seven sleepers,&rdquo; she commented
and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>It was after three o&rsquo;clock when Miriam threw
back the blanket which she had wrapped around
herself and rose softly from the chair by the bedside.
Mrs. Nash had been asleep for fully two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
hours. Miriam was thoroughly chilled and she
chafed one hand over the other as she walked noiselessly
up and down the bedroom, hoping to stimulate
circulation. She stopped finally by the table
where stood the lamp and laid her hands on its
glass globe. As she stood warming them by the
heat from the lamp, she observed a bowl of nuts
pushed toward the back of the table. Her vigil had
sharpened her appetite, and she had regretted several
times that she had neglected to ask Martha for
a night lunch.</p>

<p>Reaching over she pulled the bowl toward her and
took up one of the walnuts and the nut cracker. As
the instrument crunched over the nut, it sounded in
the stillness like a miniature firecracker and she
paused, and looked over her shoulder in alarm at
her patient. Apparently the noise had not disturbed
Mrs. Nash, for she slept peacefully on. Several
tempting pieces of the nut meat stuck in the shell
and not daring to use the nut cracker again, she
started to take up the nut pick lying in the bowl.
For fully five seconds she stood staring at it, her
hand poised in mid-air; then with one hurried, comprehensive
look about the room and at her sleeping
patient, she picked up the bowl and sped into the
hall, her flying footsteps deadened by the strip of
carpet which ran its length, and brought up breathless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
by the sofa on which Sheriff Trenholm had
thrown himself, fully dressed, a short time before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she exclaimed, keeping her voice lowered
in spite of her excitement, and she pointed to the
nut pick. It was of finest steel, about eight inches
long, with a straight, sharp point and sharpened
fluted edges running along its sides. From point to
handle it was stained a dull red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood!&rdquo; The word escaped Guy Trenholm in
little more than a whisper, and simultaneously they
turned to the undertaker&rsquo;s couch near the center
of the room on which lay all that was mortal of
Paul Abbott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wound was spindle-shaped,&rdquo; Miriam added
in a voice not quite steady, and Trenholm bowed
his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have found the weapon, undoubtedly,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="reduce">CURIOUS QUESTIONS AND EVASIVE<br />
ANSWERS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">octor Roberts</span> laid down his stethoscope
and frowned as he gazed at Mrs.
Nash, lying back on her pillow, both eyes
closed, and breathing rapidly. Leaning forward he
picked up her chart and read Miriam&rsquo;s notations
on it with a wrinkled brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must stay in bed another day,&rdquo; he said
finally. &ldquo;The flu is treacherous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s eyes slowly opened and regarded him
steadily. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your medicines?&rdquo;
she demanded. &ldquo;Why am I not better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so impatient.&rdquo; He evaded a direct reply.
&ldquo;Where is Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Asleep, I presume. She went to her room after
giving me my breakfast this morning.&rdquo; Mrs. Nash
sat up a little straighter. &ldquo;Where did you find such
a pretty woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came from the Central Registry; I know no
more than that.&rdquo; Roberts looked at her inquiringly.
&ldquo;You find her competent and intelligent?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As nurses go.&rdquo; Mrs. Nash sniffed. An argument
with Miriam that morning, in which she had
come off second best, still rankled. &ldquo;I admit that
she is nicer in the sick room than my niece Betty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Betty been with you this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; grimly. &ldquo;She was worse than useless.
Well,&rdquo; regarding Roberts attentively, &ldquo;why, do you
look at me like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty is hardly herself, Mrs. Nash, since the
tragedy of yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash did not give him time to complete
his sentence. &ldquo;So you, too, think Betty is crushed?
Well, so she is&mdash;on some one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Nash!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash smiled tolerantly and swiftly changed
the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were all those people tramping by my door
a short time ago?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coroner&rsquo;s jury,&rdquo; responded Roberts, putting
his stethoscope and sphygmomanometer in his bag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mrs. Nash sat upright; her cheeks a
brighter pink. &ldquo;Is the inquest being held here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now. It met, was sworn in, and viewed the
body,&rdquo; replied Roberts concisely. &ldquo;And then Coroner
Dixon asked for a postponement&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, for goodness&rsquo; sakes!&rdquo; demanded Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Nash. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t the man wish to catch Paul&rsquo;s
murderer?&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he does!&rdquo; Roberts was conscious of
a feeling of irritation; Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s interminable
questions were getting on his nerves. &ldquo;Sheriff Trenholm
wished more time before presenting the case,
and the inquest is held over for a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that mean that the burial has to be postponed?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>Roberts shook his head. &ldquo;The body will be removed
to the vault at the cemetery,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I do not know what arrangements Alan Mason
has made, further than that. Now, Mrs. Nash, you
must not excite yourself,&rdquo; observing her flushed
appearance with concern. &ldquo;Please lie down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash subsided among the pillows, of which
she had collected four, arranged entirely to her
liking after earnest effort on Martha&rsquo;s part to carry
out her orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you do me a favor, Doctor?&rdquo; she asked
as he rose and stood, bag in hand. &ldquo;Please give
this note to Pierre, my chauffeur, and tell him to
drive into Washington and give it to my husband.
Pierre is to return here immediately with every
article listed in the note. If I must stay here, I
will at least be comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts took the proffered note. &ldquo;I will run in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
and see you to-night before returning to Washington,&rdquo;
he volunteered. &ldquo;Sheriff Trenholm has asked
me to dine with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash raised her head. &ldquo;I recall Paul&rsquo;s father
speaking to me some years ago about a young man
in whom he was interested. His name was Guy
Trenholm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the same person,&rdquo; declared Roberts. &ldquo;Trenholm
owes much to Abbott&rsquo;s generosity; he practically
educated him. Now, Mrs. Nash, be sure and
take the medicine prescribed, and, above all, mind
what the nurse tells you.&rdquo; He chuckled at her disgusted
expression and, with a graceful bow, left the
room.</p>

<p>But Roberts had ceased smiling when he went
down the staircase and out of the house. Mrs.
Nash&rsquo;s condition puzzled him. He had been her
family physician ever since her father, Owen Carter,
the senior Congressman from his state, had taken
up his residence in Washington. A woman spoiled,
self-willed, she had held undisputed sway in her
father&rsquo;s household, while her frail mother had been
content with the role of invalid. Mrs. Nash had
allowed her eccentricities to grow upon her and
Washington society had enjoyed many a quiet laugh
at her expense. Her social position, her wealth, as
well as her undoubted good looks and her quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
wit, made her a welcome visitor. Rumors of her
approaching marriage with this dignitary and that
had been frequently circulated, in spite of her declaration
that she preferred to be an old maid. Her
marriage, therefore, to the Reverend Alexander
Nash had proved something of a sensation in their
small world. That her ambitions had been satisfied
on becoming the wife of an unknown Doctor of
Divinity, her friends and acquaintances found hard
to believe.</p>

<p>Roberts went down the path immersed in thought.
In a telephone talk that morning, Representative
Carter had expressed great anxiety about his daughter&rsquo;s
condition and begged the doctor to see her
again and curb her imprudent tendencies to neglect
her health. Thereupon Roberts had turned over his
patients in Washington to his assistant and motored
out to Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge. A cause for wonderment,
which persisted even after his talk with Mrs. Nash,
was why her father had shown such anxiety about
her and not her husband.</p>

<p>Roberts was still pondering deeply when he
reached the garage and Pierre&rsquo;s respectful, &ldquo;<i>Bonjour</i>,
Monsieur,&rdquo; brought him back to his errand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morning, Pierre,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Mrs. Nash wishes
you to run into Washington with this note for her
husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>Pierre wiped his fingers on some waste and taking
the white envelope gingerly, tucked it in the pocket
of his jumper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur, and when shall I start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I suppose. Have you lunched?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Corbin gave me some sandwiches and tea.&rdquo;
Pierre picked up his chamois and can of metal polish.
&ldquo;That car of yours, Monsieur, it is good, but it has a
slapping piston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Roberts went over to his roadster
and lifted the hood. The car was a new investment
and his pride. &ldquo;It was the pump you heard, Pierre,
and not a piston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Monsieur,&rdquo; Pierre&rsquo;s shrug was characteristic.
&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; and with a quick turn of his
supple wrists, he fastened the hood back in place.
&ldquo;But when you next start your engine, listen well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I will,&rdquo; Roberts started to enter his car
when the chauffeur addressed him again, somewhat
diffidently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Monsieur, is Madame very ill?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She fears she has the flu,&rdquo; replied Roberts. &ldquo;But
there is nothing alarming about her condition,
Pierre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she better than last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; At the servant&rsquo;s persistency Roberts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
closed the door of his car without entering it and
regarded the little chauffeur keenly. A thought
struck him. There was a perceptible pause before he
again spoke. &ldquo;When did Doctor Nash return to
Washington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday night we got in, Monsieur.&rdquo; Pierre
paused to calculate on his fingers. &ldquo;That is, Tuesday
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you came down on a night train from
New York?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, no, Monsieur. Doctor Nash and Miss Carter
leave me on the train at Baltimore on Monday
afternoon, and the doctor he reach home on Tuesday
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts&rsquo; glance at Pierre became a stare. &ldquo;And
Miss Carter?&rdquo; he questioned quickly.</p>

<p>A shrug of Pierre&rsquo;s shoulders was most expressive.
&ldquo;I know nothing, Monsieur. I leave the house
early to go to the garage and put Madame&rsquo;s car
in order.&rdquo; Swiftly he changed the subject. &ldquo;Does
Madame wish me to come back from Washington
to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I imagine from what she said, that
Mrs. Nash will be impatient for your return,&rdquo; replied
Roberts, going toward the door. &ldquo;Report to
the nurse when you reach here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>, Monsieur.&rdquo; Pierre touched his forehead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
with his finger, then as Roberts disappeared up the
walk he turned and stared at his reflection in the
polished surface of the Rolls-Royce. His little pig
eyes were keenly alert and he flecked an infinitesimal
speck of dirt from the car door before turning away
and going to his room on the floor above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to see the nurse,&rdquo; he muttered below his
breath. &ldquo;<i>Eh bien</i>&mdash;perhaps!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the snow had melted in the sudden thaw
of the night before and a comparatively mild temperature
and brilliant sunlight tempted Roberts to
stay out of doors. Turning about he strode briskly
away from the house. He had traversed half the
distance to the Patuxent River when he caught sight
of a woman approaching along the path. Her quick,
buoyant step and fine carriage first attracted his
attention, and as she drew nearer he recognized
Miriam Ward. At sight of him she hastened her
footsteps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Doctor,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Have
you seen Mrs. Nash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just come from her bedroom,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;When do you go on duty, Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This evening,&rdquo; Miriam responded. &ldquo;I left her
after breakfast. Mrs. Nash prefers to have me do
night duty. How did you find her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her general condition is better, but frankly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
there are certain symptoms that puzzle me,&rdquo; admitted
Roberts. &ldquo;I noticed by your chart that she had a
subnormal temperature this morning. Her temperature
is still down, her pulse sluggish, and respiration
rapid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She insists that she has the flu,&rdquo; Miriam pointed
out. &ldquo;But the symptoms are contradictory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo; Roberts adjusted his eyeglasses. &ldquo;That
is what puzzles me. I have made a careful examination
and find both lungs are clear. I feel that I have
not located the real trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t consider her able to sit up out of
bed?&rdquo; questioned Miriam. &ldquo;I ask because she insists
upon doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly not,&rdquo; promptly. &ldquo;The old house
is full of draughts and improperly heated, and there
might be danger of pneumonia in her run-down
condition. I left a few directions on the chart for
you,&rdquo; added Roberts; then as Miriam, with a slight
bow, started to walk past him toward the house, he
detained her with a gesture. &ldquo;Was the clergyman,
who accompanied Miss Carter on Monday night
to Abbott&rsquo;s sick room, her aunt&rsquo;s husband, the Reverend
Doctor Nash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the direct question Miriam&rsquo;s color rose. &ldquo;I am
not sure of the relationship,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the best of my recollection, he certainly mentioned
that his name was Nash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In silence Roberts fingered his hat which he had
not replaced on his head since stopping to speak
to Miriam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Betty Carter denied that she had visited
Paul,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It is most singular!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He echoed Miriam&rsquo;s thoughts, but she forbore to
comment. Taking a mere acquaintance into her
confidence was foreign to her reserved nature. Suddenly
Roberts turned to her, his fine eyes twinkling
with one of his rare smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admire your discretion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I can
be of any service at any time call upon me,&rdquo; and
with a friendly wave of his hand, he continued his
interrupted stroll toward the river.</p>

<p>As Miriam approached the house she walked more
slowly. Her hour in the fresh, invigorating air had
done her more good than any tonic, and her long,
uninterrupted sleep that morning had refreshed her.
It was her first walk about the grounds since coming
to Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, and she had admired the scenery
and well-kept appearance of the estate. For the first
time she realized the size of the house as she went
around the path that skirted it; it was far larger
than she had supposed. Entering through the sunparlor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
she halted in the dining room at sight of
Sheriff Trenholm conversing with Charles Corbin,
the caretaker.</p>

<p>Trenholm&rsquo;s attention was diverted from Corbin
by the nurse&rsquo;s arrival, and the caretaker seized the
chance to edge his portly form nearer the pantry
door. He stopped abruptly as the sheriff&rsquo;s hawklike
gaze turned swiftly back to him, and rubbed the
back of his hand across his dry lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Miss Ward,&rdquo; exclaimed Trenholm.
&ldquo;You have come most opportunely. Exactly where
did you find the bowl of nuts last night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Standing on the small lamp table in the room
now occupied by Mrs. Nash,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It was
pushed back against the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you take that nut dish there, Corbin?&rdquo;
Trenholm stepped closer as he put the question and
the caretaker wriggled his shoulders against the
wall; the support brought back his lost sense of
security. He had no love for the sheriff of the
county.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Abbott brought the nuts in some time last
week,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I disremember the exact day,
but he poured them in a bowl that usually sits over
yonder on the sideboard, and he took it away&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think again, Corbin,&rdquo; cautioned Trenholm as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the man moved uneasily. &ldquo;When did you last see
that bowl and the nut pick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I can&rsquo;t think of the exact day,&rdquo; was
the surly reply. An idea occurred to him and his
parchment-like face brightened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Martha;
she&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Trenholm&rsquo;s voice rang out clearly and
Corbin stopped where he was. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to your wife
later. Who used Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s bedroom, and after his death
it was closed,&rdquo; answered Corbin. &ldquo;But lately Mr. Paul
has used it as a sitting room. He told Martha
it made him feel that his father was nearby and he
wasn&rsquo;t so lonesome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm viewed the caretaker in silence for a
moment. &ldquo;So Mr. Paul used to sit there, did he?&rdquo;
he asked, and Corbin contented himself with a sullen
nod of his closely shaven, bullet-shaped head. &ldquo;And
when were you last in the room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning.&rdquo; Corbin dropped his eyes that
Trenholm might not read their expression of relief
at the change in the trend of his questions. &ldquo;I went
in to make up the fire for Mrs. Nash. There&rsquo;s the
telephone, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer it,&rdquo; and turning on his heel Trenholm
hastened into the living room and over to the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>In an instant Corbin was gone and Miriam almost
rubbed her eyes, so swift were his movements and
so noiseless. Pausing long enough to pour herself
out a glass of water and drink it, she followed Trenholm
into the living room. The sheriff was still
at the telephone and she walked over to Paul Abbott&rsquo;s
desk and sat down before it, intending to
wait until Trenholm was disengaged.</p>

<p>Miriam was idly playing with one of the silver
desk ornaments when she saw a package of envelopes
lying on the edge of an open leather bag,
which stood on a stool by the desk. Near at hand
was an empty scrap basket. Again Miriam&rsquo;s gaze
sought the envelopes. They were oddly familiar.
Stooping forward she took up the package and
fingered them. In quality of paper, in quantity of
stamps, they matched the half-burnt envelope which
she had picked up in her bedroom twenty-four hours
before. Her envelope was securely locked in her
grip, but she vividly remembered the Canadian postage
stamps, orange in color and five in number.</p>

<p>Miriam looked across the room at Guy Trenholm.
He was still talking at the telephone with his back
turned to her. She was oblivious of the fact that
she was distinctly visible to him in the mirror
hanging just before him on the wall.</p>

<p>Miriam studied the handwriting on the topmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
envelope&mdash;it bore Paul Abbott&rsquo;s name and address.
Swiftly she examined the address on each envelope&mdash;it
was the same&mdash;then counted them&mdash;eleven in all.
Miriam&rsquo;s thoughts reverted to the black crest on
her torn envelope. She turned over the eleven envelopes&mdash;the
flap on each was missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Ward.&rdquo; Betty Carter&rsquo;s voice just over her
shoulder made her start violently. &ldquo;Will you go to
my aunt at once; she needs you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Miriam was conscious of Betty&rsquo;s
cold regard; but there was no hurry discernible in
her movements as she replaced the rubber band
around the envelopes and laid them back on the
top of the open bag, which, she noticed for the first
time, bore, stamped upon it, Guy Trenholm&rsquo;s initials.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smcap">etty Carter</span> watched Miriam disappear
up the staircase before she moved. Crossing
the living room she stopped in front of the
fire and warmed her hands, then sitting down she
toyed idly with a string of pearls about her neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still conscious of your pearls?&rdquo; asked Guy Trenholm.
He had followed her across the room and
paused in front of her.</p>

<p>Betty crimsoned from neck to brow and her eyes
flamed with wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t refrain from insults, don&rsquo;t address
me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>It was Trenholm&rsquo;s turn to color. &ldquo;You misunderstood
me,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Seeing you playing with
your pearls reminded me of your inordinate fondness
for jewelry when in Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inordinate fondness,&rdquo; echoed Betty, and her delicately
arched eyebrows rose in displeasure. &ldquo;Your
explanation is in as questionable taste as your first
remark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;If you take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
offense so easily, we&rsquo;ll change the subject,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Where were you off to so early this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him without speaking and Trenholm
occupied the time in lighting a cigarette, after first
asking her permission, which was given with a
nod of her head.</p>

<p>When she finally spoke it was to ask a question
and not to answer his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot understand,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;why a man
of your capabilities accepted the office of sheriff.
Have you no ambition to make good in the future?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The future?&rdquo; his smile was bitter. &ldquo;The future
can take care of itself. What concerns me is the
present. Where did Pierre take you in your aunt&rsquo;s
car before breakfast this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her lips curled in a disdainful smile. &ldquo;If you
wish to know, why not question Pierre?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I prefer to come to you rather than
ask a servant,&rdquo; he stated quietly. &ldquo;Take your time,
I&rsquo;ll wait for an answer,&rdquo; and he dropped into a chair
by the side of the big sofa on which she was sitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, patience is a virtue with you,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;Is it, by chance, your only virtue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his broad shoulders. &ldquo;Time will
tell.&rdquo; A glint of humor lit his deep-set eyes. She
met his look for a second, then glanced away.</p>

<p>Through the drifting smoke of his cigarette Trenholm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
studied her intently; her beauty was undeniable
and of an unusual type. He sighed. Was the droop
at the corners of her mouth indicative of deceit?
Was it in her to play straight?</p>

<p>Betty moved restlessly, suddenly conscious of his
prolonged scrutiny. &ldquo;Suppose I tell you that I went
to early church in Upper Marlboro,&rdquo; she said suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Wednesday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. One can pray on any day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not necessarily in a church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty snuggled down more comfortably among the
cushions, but one hand, tucked carefully out of
sight, was tightly clenched. &ldquo;So you still sneer at
religion,&rdquo; she commented softly.</p>

<p>Trenholm shook his head. &ldquo;I would never scoff
did I for one instant believe that true religion has a
part in your life.&rdquo; At his answer her eyes sparkled
with anger, but she masked her feelings under an
ingratiating smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have changed, Guy Trenholm, since the old
days in France,&rdquo; she remarked, and her voice held
an undertone of feeling he failed to understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the worse?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; She lapsed into silence, which he did
not care to break. His air of strength, of self-sufficiency,
irritated her and she watched him covertly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
while pretending to be absorbed in thought. Even
her fastidious taste could find no fault with his
well-tailored riding suit and leather boots. She
grudgingly admitted to herself that the years had
brought improvement in raiment if not in manners.
Whatever else he became, he would never be metamorphosed
into a society man. No social badinage
would cover his thoughts; he would say what he had
to say with sledge-hammer effect whatever the occasion.
Betty&rsquo;s heavy sigh was audible and he
glanced at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange, is it not,&rdquo; he began, as she remained
silent, &ldquo;that you and Alan and I should be thrown
together as we were in France during the War, and
that we should meet under Paul&rsquo;s roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so very remarkable,&rdquo; she objected. &ldquo;We
have seen each other frequently during the past five
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm threw his cigarette into the fire and
leaned forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What motive inspired Paul&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>His question robbed her cheeks of color. &ldquo;Why
ask me that?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Why should I know
more than another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Paul loved you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her lips twitched and her eyes grew dim. She
put up her hand as if to ward off a blow. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
She recovered her poise, shaken for a fraction of a
second. &ldquo;I refuse to discuss Paul&rsquo;s death with you,
of all men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm considered her, slowly, carefully, as he
leaned back in his chair. &ldquo;Other men loved you,&rdquo;
he said softly. &ldquo;I, for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Paris?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quietly. He pressed his lips together.
&ldquo;Calf love&mdash;I got over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty laughed not quite steadily. &ldquo;You are to be
congratulated.&rdquo; She spoke with a mockery and
malice so neatly balanced that for a swift second
he failed to reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recovered,&rdquo; he stated, more forcefully. &ldquo;Others
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His glance held hers. &ldquo;Paul is dead, but
Alan Mason still lives in his fool&rsquo;s paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one spring she gained her feet and faced
him, trembling with rage and excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, Guy Trenholm, the role of sheriff
becomes you,&rdquo; she said, and the scorn in her voice
stung him. &ldquo;Water seeks its own level.&rdquo; She turned
away, snatched her coat from a chair where she
had left it that morning and swung out of the door.</p>

<p>Trenholm sat where he was for fully five minutes
after the front door had closed behind Betty. When
he rose he was still frowning. Going over to his
bag he tossed the package of letters inside, snapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the bag to, locked it, and taking up his cap went
in search of Martha Corbin.</p>

<p>Betty was unconscious of the distance she walked
or the direction she took. She was grateful for the
cool breeze that fanned her hot cheeks. Seldom had
she felt in such a fever; her throat was dry&mdash;parched.
She paused long enough to wipe tiny
beads of moisture from her forehead with an already
damp handkerchief. She had spent the night
in choking back sobs which racked her slender body.
Toward morning she had slept fitfully from pure
exhaustion. Only a relentless purpose spurred her
to get up, regardless of the early hour, a purpose
frustrated by&mdash;</p>

<p>Betty drew in a long breath and let it out slowly.
She stopped and gazed about for a familiar landmark.
She knew the countryside fairly well, and it
did not take her long to locate the road which led
to Upper Marlboro. She found it drier walking
on its crest and trudged slowly along, keeping a wary
eye out for automobiles which would make necessary
a hasty run for the side of the road. She
judged that she had covered about half the distance
when, in passing a wood which she remembered
was located on Abbott&rsquo;s property, she saw a man
running through the trees in her direction. Something
furtive in his movements as he dodged among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the leafless trees and bushes caused her heart to
beat more rapidly, and she cast a glance behind
her. No vehicle, horse-drawn or motor-driven, was
in sight. Betty faltered and came to a stop, then,
throwing off her unreasoning fear, she hurried forward,
glancing neither to the right nor the left.</p>

<p>Betty had passed the wood and was breathing
more easily when she detected the sound of following
footsteps and she heard her name called once,
and then again with more insistence. She kept
straight ahead, for if recollection did not play her
false, a farmhouse was around the next bend in the
road. She had almost gained the turn, when a man&rsquo;s
shadow was thrown on the snow just in front of
her, and facing to her left she found Charles Corbin,
the caretaker, at her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Miss Betty,&rdquo; he said, with a tug at the
visor of his cap. &ldquo;I thought ye heard me coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s feeling of relief found vent in a slight
laugh. &ldquo;Dear me, Corbin; I wish I had recognized
you sooner. Why, I was actually running away
from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin&rsquo;s parchment-like face opened in an expansive
grin which showed his yellow teeth. &ldquo;Running
away, was you, Miss Betty?&rdquo; His voice
dropped to a confidential pitch. &ldquo;Take it from me,
don&rsquo;t ye do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Betty ceased laughing with startling abruptness
and stared at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, Corbin?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>His right eye opened and closed in a most expressive
wink. &ldquo;I want to speak to ye, Miss Betty,
confidential like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she drew back and looked at him in
dawning comprehension. &ldquo;Are you drunk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I never touch liquor.&rdquo; He slipped his hand
inside his tightly buttoned coat and drew out a
woman&rsquo;s silk scarf and held it just beyond her
reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where ye dropped it the morning of Mr. Paul&rsquo;s
murder.&rdquo; As he spoke he shook out the scarf. &ldquo;The
blood&rsquo;s still on it,&rdquo; and he leered at her as she
raised her eyes and looked at him. It was some
seconds before she spoke, and her voice was not
quite natural.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s your price?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Corbin licked his lips. &ldquo;How much ye got with
ye?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>From an inside pocket she drew out a bill folder
containing &ldquo;A.B.A.&rdquo; travelers&rsquo; checks. Only one was
left, but tucked behind it were two yellow-back
Treasury notes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can give you a check for fifty dollars or these
two twenty-dollar bills,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the money&mdash;on account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The look she gave him was expressive of her
feelings, but wasted on Corbin. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Hand me the scarf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; He held it behind him. &ldquo;Not till I
get five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five hundred dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;that&rsquo;s what Sheriff Trenholm will give for
it and, eh, other information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty threw back her head and eyed him defiantly.
&ldquo;If you go to the sheriff he will give you
what every blackmailer deserves&mdash;nothing.&rdquo; And
she replaced the bills in the check folder. Corbin
eyed the vanishing money in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I am a
poor man. I&rsquo;ll take the money&mdash;and your word for
the rest.&rdquo; His fingers closed greedily over the
Treasury notes as he relinquished the scarf. With
a mumbled word, of which Betty was oblivious, he
hastened back the way he had come.</p>

<p>Betty stood where she was in indecision. Finally
she turned and watched Corbin reënter the woods.
Convinced that he was not likely to return she continued
on her way toward Upper Marlboro, the scarf
safely tucked inside the pocket of her fur coat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
She had gone some little distance when she came
to an open field and saw, close to the road, in a
slight hollow, a huge boulder from which the snow
had melted, leaving exposed the dry rock.</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s hesitation was brief. Climbing the fence,
she turned her back on the road and placing the
scarf on the rock she drew out a silver match box.
The first match failed to light, with the second she
was more successful, and three minutes later the
scarf was a smoldering heap of ashes. Drawing in
her breath she blew them off the rock, and with a
lighter heart, regained the road just in time to
recognize her aunt&rsquo;s Rolls-Royce approaching,
Pierre at the wheel. The recognition was mutual
and the powerful car came to a stop. Before the
little chauffeur could climb out of his seat the limousine
door was swung open and Doctor Nash sprang
to Betty&rsquo;s side, and assisted her into the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Betty!&rdquo; he exclaimed, at her
wet boots. &ldquo;You are most imprudent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As usual.&rdquo; A sigh accompanied the words and
Doctor Nash turned and scanned her closely. Her
brilliant color and the sparkle of her eyes accentuated
the haggard lines caused by harassing thoughts and
sleepless nights, but did not detract from her beauty.
Nash&rsquo;s critical expression softened and Betty, quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
to read his thoughts, laid her hand in his. &ldquo;I need
your help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can count on me, Betty, always.&rdquo; Nash
spoke with warmth and Betty&rsquo;s color deepened. She
paused, however, before addressing him again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise me,&rdquo; she began, sinking her voice so
that he had to bend nearer to catch what she said.
&ldquo;Promise me not to admit to Sheriff Trenholm that
you and I were at Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge on Monday
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash straightened up with a jerk. &ldquo;Betty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s soft voice was pathos itself.
There was silence in the limousine and Pierre
dropped his eyes from the vision mirror in which
were plainly outlined the likenesses of his two
passengers in time to turn into the driveway to
Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge and stop under the <i>porte cochère</i>.</p>

<p>Nash sighed deeply. &ldquo;Does your aunt know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty shook her head. &ldquo;No one must know,&rdquo; she
protested vehemently. &ldquo;<i>No one.</i>&rdquo; She looked at him
and the wistful, pleading appeal in her lovely eyes
stirred him out of himself.</p>

<p>His low but fervid &ldquo;Betty&rdquo; reached not only her
ears, but Alan Mason&rsquo;s, who stood by the door
of the car, held open by the attentive Pierre.</p>

<p>Alan broke the pause. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come,
Nash,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your wife is worse.&rdquo;</p>

from Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s wrist, after taking her
pulse, and then bowed gravely to her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wife has rallied and we can safely leave
her with the nurse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come, Nash, you must
be very weary after your anxious night,&rdquo; and laying
his hand persuasively on his companion&rsquo;s
shoulder he gently pushed him toward the hall door,
then turned back to speak to Miriam. &ldquo;I will be
downstairs in the living room if you need me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam, in the act of preparing Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
medicine, did not answer. Going over to the bed
she aroused the drowsy woman, helped her to a
sitting position and held the medicine glass to her
lips. Mrs. Nash drank slowly, and then settled
back with a low sigh. Miriam busied herself about
the bedroom for ten minutes before returning to
the chair by the bed and found her patient regarding
her steadfastly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did my husband get here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Around six o&rsquo;clock yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; replied
Miriam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not remember.&rdquo; Mrs. Nash passed her
hand before her eyes. &ldquo;He came while I was unconscious&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Now, Mrs. Nash, don&rsquo;t talk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he with me all night?&rdquo; Paying no attention
to Miriam, she struggled up on her elbow as she
put the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was in and out of the room most of the
night,&rdquo; Miriam bent over and adjusted the bedclothes.
&ldquo;Doctor Roberts was here also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash was silent for some little time, her eyes
roving about the big room, into which the daylight
was stealing through the partly open windows;
finally she gazed again at her nurse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t so ill that I could not appreciate what
you did for me,&rdquo; she said, and Miriam was surprised
at the amount of feeling in her voice. &ldquo;I
shan&rsquo;t forget it, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mrs. Nash, you must not excite yourself,&rdquo;
Miriam protested, coloring warmly at her
praise. &ldquo;Please lie down again and try to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about you?&rdquo; with a keen glance at her.
&ldquo;Have you had any sleep? Ah, I can see you
haven&rsquo;t, so don&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo; The injunction slipped out
with Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s customary abruptness and Miriam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
could not forbear a smile. Undoubtedly Mrs. Nash
was recovering. &ldquo;Go and lie down on that cot which
I had Martha bring here yesterday afternoon for
you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid&rdquo;&mdash;with a fleeting smile&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make my wants known.&rdquo; And considering the argument
settled Mrs. Nash turned to a more comfortable
position and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Without moving Miriam considered her in silence.
It was only when she heard Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s regular
breathing and realized that she had fallen into peaceful
slumber that she walked over to the cot and,
drawing back the heavy blanket, threw herself,
dressed as she was, down upon it. Her head had
hardly touched the pillow before she was sound
asleep. An hour passed and she still slept on, totally
unaware that some one had stealthily entered the
room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash stirred, opened her eyes and sat up.
What was the noise which had awakened her? Her
eyes darted about the room as she turned her head
from side to side, and she bent this way and that
to get a better view of each piece of furniture.
A gentle snore from Miriam suggested a solution&mdash;had
a louder snore aroused her? Mrs. Nash lay
back among the pillows, but she did not close her
eyes.</p>

<p>It was close upon eight o&rsquo;clock when Miriam awoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
and, refreshed by her long nap, sprang up, to find
Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bright black eyes regarding her with an
expression she could not fathom.</p>

<p>The desultory conversation about the breakfast
table ceased altogether with the departure into the
pantry of Anna, the capable daughter of a neighboring
farmer, whom Martha had secured to aid
her in caring for the guests at Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.
She had often assisted Martha when Paul Abbott
and his father had entertained parties in the hunting
season and her familiarity with the household arrangements
made her presence invaluable at the
moment to the overworked housekeeper, whose duties
had multiplied with the alarming illness of Mrs.
Nash.</p>

<p>Doctor Roberts and Alan Mason had eaten with
relish Martha&rsquo;s buckwheat cakes and country sausage,
but Alexander Nash scarcely tasted a mouthful
of the appetizing breakfast, contenting himself
with several cups of black coffee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must you return to Washington, Roberts?&rdquo; he
asked, pushing aside his plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I must be at Garfield by noon for an important
operation.&rdquo; Roberts paused to light a cigar
handed to him by Alan. &ldquo;There is every reason
to believe that Mrs. Nash will continue to improve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash looked moodily at the unused knife which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
was balancing between his fingers. &ldquo;Is there any
country doctor in the neighborhood, Alan, whom we
could call on in an emergency?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Alan stopped to knock the ashes
from his cigar into his coffee cup. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get in touch
with Trenholm and ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; exclaimed Roberts, as Alan pushed
back his chair, preparatory to rising. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,
Nash, how competent the country doctors are, but
you can safely trust Miss Ward should another
crisis arise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nurse?&rdquo; The question was put by Nash
with raised eyebrows, and Roberts frowned. He
did not relish the clergyman&rsquo;s tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The nurse,&rdquo; he repeated, with dry emphasis.
&ldquo;But for her keeping her wits about her Mrs. Nash
would have died yesterday afternoon, before I could
get to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the cause of my wife&rsquo;s critical condition?&rdquo;
asked Nash. &ldquo;You have never told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heart collapse,&rdquo; tersely. &ldquo;Miss Ward&rsquo;s prompt
use of camphorated oil, administered hypodermically,
brought her around, however, and her clever
nursing has aided materially in her recovery from
the attack. Come, Nash, don&rsquo;t be so downhearted;
you can place every confidence in Miss Ward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash laid down his napkin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
in my mind if you will return,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Miss
Ward is undoubtedly clever, but, at that, only a
nurse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A damned fine looking one!&rdquo; ejaculated Alan,
emerging from behind a screen of tobacco smoke.
&ldquo;Come, Nash, why have you taken such a prejudice
against her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash glanced angrily at the younger man, but
refrained from a direct answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we drop the discussion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
will be greatly obliged, Roberts, if you will promise
to get back later to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; was Roberts&rsquo; noncommittal reply.
&ldquo;It depends upon how I find my patients and my
assistant&rsquo;s report whether I can spend to-night here.
I will run up now and see Mrs. Nash,&rdquo; and not
waiting to hear anything further, he left the dining
room.</p>

<p>As Roberts reached the second floor, Miriam rose
from her seat in the alcove, where she had been
eating her breakfast, and accompanied him into the
sick room. Mrs. Nash, with Martha sitting watchfully
by the bed, was dozing, and Roberts refrained
from arousing her. Once again in the hall he paused
to speak to Miriam before going down the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep up the same treatment,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
not let her exert herself in any way, and no excitement,
mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam hesitated. &ldquo;Is she to see any one?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I leave that to your discretion.&rdquo; He paused for
thought. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t permit any discussion&mdash;any arguments.&rdquo;
He came back a step. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let her
mind dwell too much on Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s murder, and
discourage her from talking about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, Doctor.&rdquo; Miriam looked down the empty
hall, and then back at Roberts. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
you had better get a second nurse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessary now,&rdquo; exclaimed Roberts.
&ldquo;In fact, two nurses would alarm Mrs. Nash unduly
about her condition. You are getting some sleep,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m supposed to be off duty now, but I
don&rsquo;t like to leave her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, have Martha alternate with Miss Carter in
the sick room; they can call you if she has another
attack.&rdquo; He noticed her change in expression, and,
struck by an idea, asked in a lower voice: &ldquo;Are Mrs.
Nash and her niece on good terms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; glancing at him in surprise, and
Roberts looked sharply at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I have seen nothing to make me think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
otherwise,&rdquo; with more insistence, as he still looked
dubious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Carter now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Breakfasting in her room, Martha told me. She
has volunteered to spend the morning with her aunt,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must go to your room and rest.&rdquo;
Roberts started down the staircase. &ldquo;I have promised
Nash to return to-night. If an emergency
arises, you have my telephone number,&rdquo; and the busy
physician hurried away just as Martha appeared in
Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Miss&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she came further into
the hall at sight of Miriam. &ldquo;Mrs. Nash is sleeping
nicely. Can I get Miss Betty to come to her
aunt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, Martha,&rdquo; but the housekeeper still hung
back, instead of going on her errand, and she added,
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha came nearer and lowered her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before she fell asleep she said to tell you to ask
her husband to send for her maid, Somers, to come
and help take care of her,&rdquo; and her message delivered
in one breathless sentence, Martha went down
the hall to Betty&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>

<p>Miriam went thoughtfully over to the alcove and
arranged the soiled dishes on her breakfast tray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
while she considered Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s message. If
Somers was the right kind of person she would be
invaluable. Martha&rsquo;s white face, and nervous, excitable
manner pointed inevitably to one conclusion&mdash;Martha&rsquo;s
usefulness as a nurse&rsquo;s aid would
soon be a thing of the past, indeed, if indications
could be depended upon, she might become a patient
herself; for to Miriam&rsquo;s practiced eye, the housekeeper
was on the verge of a nervous collapse.</p>

<p>From where she stood in the window, Miriam
caught sight of Alan talking to Doctor Nash in the
driveway which led to the garage. Apparently Alan
spoke rapidly, with quick jerky movements of his
hands, while the clergyman contented himself with a
nod of his head now and then; suddenly Alan whirled
around and went in the direction of the garage.
Nash, left to himself, stood still for a minute, then
commenced pacing slowly up and down, each turn
bringing him nearer the house. Miriam&rsquo;s eyes
brightened. Here was her opportunity to deliver
Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s message and to talk to Nash undisturbed.
Since his arrival in the sick room the night
before she had had no chance to speak to him, other
than brief statements as to his wife&rsquo;s condition.
But she had recognized him instantly upon his entrance
as Betty Carter&rsquo;s companion on Monday
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>Leaving the breakfast tray for Martha to take to
the pantry, Miriam ran lightly down the staircase
and out of the front door. The driveway was entirely
clear of snow and at the sound of Miriam&rsquo;s
tread on the gravel, Nash looked over his shoulder
and halted abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does my wife need me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to
her at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, wait.&rdquo; Miriam, to her surprise, was breathing
rapidly, and paused to recover herself. What
was there about this middle-aged man confronting
her to make her nervous? A certain hardness about
the clean-shaven, handsome mouth, a drooping lid
which partly covered one of his blue eyes&mdash;no, they
did not account for her instinctive dread of the
clergyman. She caught Nash&rsquo;s surprise at her continued
silence and spoke in haste to cover her embarrassment.
&ldquo;Miss Carter is with your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you are out for a walk. Pardon me
for detaining you,&rdquo; and Nash raised his hat, intending
to move on, but Miriam checked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Your wife
wishes you to send for Somers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somers?&rdquo; questioningly. &ldquo;Ah, very well. I will
go at once and telephone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again I must detain you.&rdquo; Miriam spoke with
assurance. She had caught sight of Guy Trenholm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
as he turned the corner of the house and came toward
them. Her eyes brightened. Trenholm had come
most opportunely. Unconscious of her added color,
she turned to the silent man regarding her, as Trenholm
paused by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Nash,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I have told Sheriff
Trenholm of Miss Carter&rsquo;s visit to Mr. Paul Abbott
on Monday night just before he was murdered and
that you accompanied her and, in my absence from
the sick room, performed the marriage ceremony.
Will you kindly confirm that statement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander Nash eyed her and Trenholm, then his
gaze swept upward to a window of his wife&rsquo;s bedroom
where Betty Carter stood looking down at
them. His gaze turned again to Miriam and the
silent, attentive sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Monday night?&rdquo; he asked, and his voice was
under admirable control. &ldquo;I fail to recall any such
occurrence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly Miriam took in the meaning of his words.
Her face flamed scarlet, then went deadly white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You liar! You despicable liar!&rdquo; she cried, and
Trenholm caught her outflung hand. For one moment
they confronted each other, then Nash broke
the tense pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hysterics,&rdquo; he commented, pursing up his lips.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
&ldquo;Can you manage her, Sheriff, or shall I sent out
one of the women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm looked down at Miriam, then across at
Nash. &ldquo;I need no assistance,&ldquo; he said, and the dryness
of his voice was not lost on the clergyman.
&ldquo;You need not wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam tried to free herself from Trenholm&rsquo;s
grasp as Nash went inside the house. Suddenly she
ceased struggling and rested limply against him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel better?&rdquo; he asked, and the human
sympathy in his voice almost broke her down. &ldquo;Shall
I get you a glass of wine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute.&rdquo;
Miriam straightened up as she regained her self-control.
She laid one hand over her rapidly beating
heart, but her eyes did not falter in her direct gaze
at him. &ldquo;I owe you an apology for creating a
scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm looked at her long and searchingly.
From behind a box hedge which skirted the walk,
Pierre, the chauffeur, watched the tableau. He was
too far away to hear what was said, but the sheriff&rsquo;s
expression provided him with food for thought.</p>

<p>Miriam broke the protracted pause. &ldquo;Doctor
Nash does not speak like an American,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;What is his nationality?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm turned to accompany her into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
house. They had reached the veranda before he
answered her question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nash is a Canadian,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Take care&mdash;watch
that step,&rdquo; as she stumbled.</p>

<p>Miriam slowly released his strong hand, which she
had clutched instinctively to keep her balance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; She looked up again and Trenholm
noticed the distended pupils of her eyes. &ldquo;I shall not
trip again.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">iriam</span> hung up the telephone receiver
with a dissatisfied frown. For the third
time her talk with the nurse in Doctor
Roberts&rsquo; office had been cut off, and her appeal to
the local operator at Upper Marlboro for a clear line
had brought no results. Moving away from the telephone
table she stood hesitating in the center of the
living room. Should she go back to her bedroom
and lie down again, or go out for a walk? The
latter alternative was the most inviting, although
reason told her she should try to sleep. Sleep!
She had tossed and turned on her pillow for two
mortal hours and never closed her eyes. Always
before her was the scene with Alexander Nash and
Guy Trenholm. Later, her mind reverted to Betty
Carter&rsquo;s denial of her presence at Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.
Twice she had been branded a liar&mdash;was she to sit
down tamely under it?</p>

<p>Miriam ran softly upstairs to her room, her mind
made up. Putting on her coat and hat, she hurried
down the hall again, and heard, as she passed Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Nash&rsquo;s partly open bedroom door, the sound of a
male voice addressing the sick woman. So Doctor
Nash was with his wife! Miriam did not linger.</p>

<p>As she started to close the front door behind her,
the telephone bell rang loudly and she hastily entered
the living room. Her unexpected return was
a trifle disconcerting to Pierre, the chauffeur, who
had started from the pantry to answer the telephone.
At sight of the nurse standing with the instrument
in her hands, he ducked behind the newel post and
kept carefully out of sight, while listening intently
to what was said.</p>

<p>The call was from the operator at Upper Marlboro,
and a second later Miriam was again speaking
to Doctor Roberts&rsquo; office nurse. This time there
were no interruptions and Miriam&rsquo;s talk with the
nurse was clear and, from her viewpoint, satisfactory.
Ten minutes later Miriam was tramping
across Abbott&rsquo;s estate, careless as to the direction
she was taking, providing it led away from the
house of mystery.</p>

<p>Pierre slipped from behind the newel post in time
to escape Martha as the latter went about her household
work, a reluctant Anna in tow. The murder of
Paul Abbott had created a sensation throughout the
county, and, as the mystery surrounding the case
deepened, the old hunting lodge gained a reputation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
for ghosts and horrors which kept visitors at a
respectful distance, the morbidly curious only daring
to venture near it in the daytime. Anna had consented
to &ldquo;help out&rdquo; provided she did not have to go
above the first floor and could be taken home by
Corbin in the Abbott car before nine o&rsquo;clock in
the evening. Pierre&rsquo;s attentions, as he waited in the
pantry, supplied a new thrill, which the country girl
found a pleasant diversion from Martha&rsquo;s sullen
irritability and Corbin&rsquo;s unwholesome leers.</p>

<p>It was approaching the luncheon hour when, from
his seat by the kitchen window, Pierre perceived
Alexander Nash and Corbin talking together on the
roadway. Corbin, on his way from the woodshed
with a wheelbarrow of wood, had stopped and set
down his barrow at a sign from the clergyman.
From his gesticulations, Pierre gathered that he was
indicating the points of the compass, but the little
chauffeur did not wait to see more. Martha&rsquo;s back
was turned as she put several pies in the oven, and
Anna had gone for an instant into the servants&rsquo;
dining room. Like a flash Pierre was out of the
door and up the back staircase to the second floor.
His low knock on Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s door was answered
by Betty Carter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bonjour</i>, Mademoiselle!&ldquo; he exclaimed, bowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
respectfully. &ldquo;I came to inquire for the health of
Madame.&rdquo; His voice carried to Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s sharp
ears and she sat up in bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admit Pierre, Betty,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;I wish to
speak to him.&rdquo; At her imperious tone her niece
opened the door still further and Pierre stepped
inside. With a quick click of his heels, he bowed
from the hips, his hands crossed before him, and
then advanced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame is better!&rdquo; And his respectful tone
held a note of genuine relief. Mrs. Nash was a kind
mistress and her servants were devoted to her. &ldquo;Ah,
Madame, I have been anxious&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Pierre.&rdquo; Mrs. Nash was touched. She
had, with Betty&rsquo;s aid, slipped on a becoming dressing
sacque, one of the articles brought from Washington
by her husband the evening before, and her boudoir
cap was attractively arranged. &ldquo;Have you heard
from Somers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame. Doctor Nash directed her to take
the afternoon train for Upper Marlboro, and I will
be there to meet her,&rdquo; explained the chauffeur. He
turned to Betty. &ldquo;Your bag, Mademoiselle, came
by express just now and Corbin has placed it in
your room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash understood Betty&rsquo;s quickly checked
motion toward the hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Run along, Betty, and see to your bag,&rdquo; she said,
good-naturedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you in here every
minute, and will ring the bell if I require anything,&rdquo;
touching the brass ornament which Martha had
resurrected from a china cabinet for her use. &ldquo;Well,
Pierre, have you followed instructions?&rdquo; she added
in a lower key, as Betty vanished out of sight.</p>

<p>Pierre carefully closed the hall door and then came
over to the bed, and placed a small paper in Mrs.
Nash&rsquo;s outstretched hand. Silently she read the few
lines of familiar writing before addressing the
expectant servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you find this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Pierre&rsquo;s smile was illuminating. &ldquo;Corbin has his
price,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;What next, Madame?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash sat up a trifle straighter and pointed to
the bureau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find a roll of money in the top drawer,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Bring it over here.&rdquo; Pierre complied
with her directions so speedily that she had but a
second in which to secrete the paper. Taking the
money from the chauffeur, she handed him a generous
sum. &ldquo;Be watchful, Pierre,&rdquo; she cautioned, as
he put back the remainder of the bills in their place
in the drawer. &ldquo;Overlook nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oui</i>, Madame.&rdquo; Pierre halted on his way to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
hall door, struck by a sudden idea. &ldquo;The nurse,
Mees Ward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what about her?&rdquo; as he hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She plans to leave to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s color changed. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard her telephone to Doctor Roberts to bring
another nurse to take her place.&rdquo; Pierre explained,
and then waited respectfully for her to address him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash viewed the chauffeur in silence and
then glanced about the sunny room. It seemed suddenly
cold and bare to her. When she spoke her
voice had altered to a shriller key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you go along the hall, Pierre, ask my niece
to return,&rdquo; she directed, and closing her eyes she
laid down again, one hand stroking, as if for companionship,
the tongue of the brass bell.</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s walk along the Patuxent River finally
brought her to a bridge connecting the highway, and
she paused to rest on its parapet. It was a rolling
country and she had walked up hill and down dale
before striking the river bank. She had put on her
high boots for cross-country walking, but she had
not found the ground as soft as she anticipated, the
snow of four days before having entirely vanished
except in a few sheltered nooks and crannies.</p>

<p>The view from the bridge diverted Miriam&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
thoughts, and she studied the panorama spread before
her with interest. Perched high on a hill close
at hand was a colonial mansion, its white pillars and
gabled roof a fair landmark to be seen for miles,
while toward the valley nearer the river, and obviously
on the same estate, was a low building, the
architecture of which suggested a church or chapel.</p>

<p>Miriam was still speculating on her surroundings
when she caught sight of a solitary horseman riding
across the fields to her right. The man rode with
the unmistakable seat of an American cavalryman,
and horse and rider seemed one as they cleared the
low fences and swung at last into the highway,
headed for the bridge. As he crossed the bridge,
Guy Trenholm checked his horse with such suddenness
that a shower of mud bespattered Miriam, and
his first words, instead of greeting, were an apology.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I ruined your coat?&rdquo; he asked, in deep contrition,
as he sprang to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A whisk-broom will remove the damage,&rdquo;
Miriam replied lightly. &ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t try to
rub it off!&rdquo; as Trenholm drew out his handkerchief.
&ldquo;It must dry first. Where are you going in such a
hurry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not going&mdash;returning,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;This is
my bailiwick, that&mdash;&rdquo; pointing in the direction from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
which he had come&mdash;&ldquo;is Anne Arundel County, and
my jurisdiction ends at the river&rsquo;s bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you dignify that stream with the title of
river?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so scornful,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;To-day
it is a stream, but in the War of 1812 the British
men-o&rsquo;-war sailed up it to this point, burned down
the original colonial homestead yonder,&rdquo; indicating
the mansion Miriam had been admiring, &ldquo;and sailed
away again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam was paying scant attention to his historical
facts, instead she was considering his previous statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So your jurisdiction ends at the river,&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;And a criminal has simply to run across
the bridge to elude you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is a fast runner,&rdquo; dryly. Trenholm stroked
his horse&rsquo;s soft nostril, as the chestnut mare rubbed
her head against his arm and nosed in his pocket
for the apple and sugar she so dearly loved and
always found. &ldquo;Also, there&rsquo;s a sheriff in Anne
Arundel County. Are you returning to Abbott&rsquo;s
Lodge, or,&rdquo; his eyes twinkled, &ldquo;thinking of a sprint
across Hills Bridge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My conscience is clear,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I am
on my way to the Lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let me show you a short cut,&rdquo; and, taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
her consent for granted, Trenholm led the way off
the high road and along a footpath, his mare walking
contentedly along behind them. Miriam, a lover
of horses, stopped every now and then to caress her,
unconscious of the charming picture she made, her
mind carefree for the moment, and her cheeks glowing
from her long walk in the wind.</p>

<p>They had gone fully three quarters of the distance
to the Lodge when the footpath took a sudden turn
to the right and, crossing a wood, skirted a small
graveyard. The unexpected sight caused Miriam
to start slightly and she took in the air of desolation
and the unkept appearance of the graves with a sense
of depression which she strove to shake off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Masons&rsquo; family burying ground,&rdquo; explained
Trenholm, observing her change of expression. &ldquo;It
is now part of Abbott&rsquo;s estate. Not a very cheerful
sight, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam shook her head. &ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; she echoed,
and paused idly to count the headstones, some still
standing upright, while others, badly chipped and
lichen-covered, reclined on the ground. &ldquo;Twelve,&rdquo;
she announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thirteen,&rdquo; added Trenholm, pointing to a
grave a little distance from the others and running
obliquely to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, I didn&rsquo;t see that one,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Why is it placed in that manner&mdash;outside the pale,
so to speak?&rdquo; and she touched a piece of rusty iron
which had once formed the fence around the family
plot. A number of other upright pieces of iron
indicated the line it had once taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a suicide&rsquo;s grave,&rdquo; explained Trenholm.
&ldquo;There is an old superstition among the negroes
that such a grave cannot be dug straight or on
line with the others. Shall we walk on, Miss Ward?&rdquo;
and turning, he whistled to his mare, standing some
distance down the path.</p>

<p>They were both rather silent, Miriam, her momentary
lapse into her old, gay self, having dropped back
into a depression deeper than before, while Trenholm
watched her with an absorption of which he was
totally unaware.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you will be late for luncheon,&rdquo; he remarked,
happening to glance at his wrist watch as
he put his hand on the bridle rein of the mare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she replied absently. &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t inconvenience them, for Martha doesn&rsquo;t expect
me. I should be asleep, you know.&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should indeed,&rdquo; he said, and she wondered
at his emphatic tone. &ldquo;This is no preparation for
night duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am not going on duty to-night,&rdquo; she broke
in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving the case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Trenholm stopped abruptly and eyed
her in concern. &ldquo;Fired?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; She flushed hotly. &ldquo;Do you suppose
I can take care of Mrs. Nash after her husband&rsquo;s
treatment of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not answer at once. &ldquo;So you are running
away,&rdquo; he commented softly. &ldquo;Frankly, I did not
expect it of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trenholm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Running away,&rdquo; he reiterated, paying not the
slightest attention to her indignant ejaculation.
&ldquo;Running away under fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; she flared back. &ldquo;Do you
suppose I&rsquo;ll stay in any house where I&rsquo;ve twice been
called a liar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; he retorted, with
equal heat. &ldquo;You cannot leave Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge,
Miss Ward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She gazed at him astounded. &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you are the last person known to have
seen Paul Abbott alive,&rdquo; he pointed out slowly.
&ldquo;And your statements regarding the events of Monday
night are unsubstantiated.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Miriam stared at him as if unable to believe her
ears. &ldquo;Do you insinuate I lied?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>Trenholm&rsquo;s hand on his horse&rsquo;s rein tightened
until the knuckles shone white, but his glance did
not waver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a question of my opinion one way or the
other,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;You are our chief witness,
and as sheriff of Prince Georges County, I cannot
permit you to leave Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam regarded him intently. &ldquo;So that is your
attitude,&rdquo; she said, finally. &ldquo;I am glad to have it
defined. You have, at least,&rdquo; with a ghost of a
smile, &ldquo;been honest with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; Trenholm drew a step nearer.
&ldquo;Your reasonable acceptance of the situation encourages
me to ask a personal question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she prompted, as he paused. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your interest in the black seal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam stared at him, thunderstruck. &ldquo;The black
seal?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;the seal which you have traced many times
on paper,&rdquo; and from his coat pocket he drew a number
of papers, and held them so that Miriam could
see the drawings she had made at odd moments while
in the sick room. They were cleverly done&mdash;distinct
and clear in every detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>Miriam looked first at them and then up at Trenholm,
standing silent and stern by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those drawings were in my bag last night,&rdquo; she
stammered. &ldquo;How did you get them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I examined your bag,&rdquo; calmly.</p>

<p>Her eyes were dark with anger. Twice her voice
failed her. &ldquo;You are impossible&mdash;intolerable&mdash;&rdquo;
she gasped, and turning ran toward Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge,
in her blind haste passing Alan Mason without
recognition. The latter stopped and stared after her,
then catching sight of Guy Trenholm standing
patiently by his mare, he whistled softly to himself.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> undertaker&rsquo;s assistant looked in deep
embarrassment at Betty Carter as he remained
standing in front of the closed
door of the room where lay Paul Abbott&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Those are the
sheriff&rsquo;s orders. No one is to go into the room
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; demanded Betty. &ldquo;The funeral will
be held in half an hour, and&rdquo;&mdash;her voice quivered&mdash;&ldquo;I
want to&mdash;to see him before the casket is closed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thompson moved uneasily from one foot to the
other; Betty&rsquo;s distress disturbed him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
sorry,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;Indeed I am&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not
possible. Perhaps,&rdquo; his face brightened as the idea
occurred to him, &ldquo;perhaps you can see Mr. Trenholm
and get his permission. Here he comes now,&ldquo; as a
figure appeared at the far end of the corridor and
came toward them. &ldquo;Oh, pshaw! it&rsquo;s a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somers, Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s maid, greeted Betty in a
subdued voice. &ldquo;Please, Miss Betty,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Where will I find your aunt? The young woman
who let me in declined to come upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Betty glanced impatiently at the British maid.
&ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; she turned as she spoke, then
hesitated and addressed Thompson. &ldquo;If you see
Sheriff Trenholm tell him, please, I must go in this
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss,&rdquo; and Thompson, considerably relieved
by the maid&rsquo;s opportune arrival, resumed his slow
pacing back and forth before the door.</p>

<p>The sound of his voice and Betty&rsquo;s had carried
inside the bedroom, but neither of the two men in it
paid the slightest attention. The photographer put
up his plates and closed his camera.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken four views, Mr. Trenholm,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Is that enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm nodded as he handed the man his flashlight
apparatus. &ldquo;Develop the plates and let me
have the prints as quickly as possible,&rdquo; he directed.
&ldquo;Do you need any assistance?&rdquo; as the photographer
shouldered his camera, tripod, and utility box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo; In spite of his haste to be gone,
the man was careful to walk as far from the undertaker&rsquo;s
couch with its silent figure as the limits of
the room permitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get these to you to-night.
Where shall I send the photographs? Here, or to
your home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My home,&rdquo; briefly. Trenholm held open the hall
door for him to pass through, then spoke a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
whispered words to Thompson. Ten minutes later
the body of Paul Abbott had been carried downstairs
and the casket closed, while arrangements for the
funeral went steadily on.</p>

<p>Trenholm listened impassively to Thompson&rsquo;s
flurried delivery of Betty&rsquo;s message, the latter
having forgotten it utterly in his astonishment at
finding Trenholm had been in the bedroom at the
time Betty wished to enter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The casket is not to be opened again,&rdquo; the sheriff
said sternly. &ldquo;Understand, Thompson&mdash;under no
circumstances is it to be opened,&rdquo; and turning he
mounted the staircase and found Betty standing at
the top landing, waiting for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard what you said,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;And would
like an explanation of your extraordinary conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing extraordinary about it,&rdquo; Trenholm
replied quietly. &ldquo;If you really insist upon an
explanation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; her passion rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul died Monday night&mdash;this is Thursday,&rdquo; he
spoke gravely. &ldquo;A change has already set in and it
is not possible to keep the casket open longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty was thankful for the railing of the stairs
to lean against.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never been permitted to be with him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never alone.&rdquo; She had turned ghastly in color.
&ldquo;Always you have had some one stationed in the
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm looked at her in growing concern.
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better rest?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The funeral
will take place in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm was doubtful if she heard him, so fixed
was her stare. He turned quickly to see what had
focused her attention. Standing by the newel post
was Alexander Nash in earnest conversation with
Alan Mason and a third man, the rector of the
Episcopal church at Upper Marlboro. Trenholm
laid his hand on Betty&rsquo;s arm. It was shaken off
instantly and she shot down the hall to her bedroom
without further word. Trenholm stood in thought
for several minutes and then joined Alan Mason.</p>

<p>The hands of the grandfather clock in the living
room were pointing to three when the funeral services
commenced. Betty, accompanied by Alexander
Nash, was the last to enter and take the seat reserved
for her by Alan Mason&rsquo;s side. A few friends
from Washington had motored out to Abbott&rsquo;s
Lodge, while the residents in the vicinity had come
in a body to attend the services.</p>

<p>Upstairs in her bedroom Mrs. Nash motioned to
Somers to come to her, and with reluctance the
Englishwoman left her post by the door where she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
had been keeping an attentive ear for all that was
transpiring below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me up,&rdquo; ordered Mrs. Nash, in a tone
Somers had learned not to disregard. &ldquo;Get my slippers
and wrapper.&rdquo; She was panting from her
exertions when she finally reached the hall door, a
protesting Somers struggling to steady her with
a feverish grasp of her elbow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, be quiet, Somers; I can&rsquo;t hear a word,&rdquo; and
Mrs. Nash appeared in the hall and peered down it.
Shifting her husband&rsquo;s cane, which she had picked
up on her way from the room, to the other hand, she
rested her weight on Somers&rsquo; arm, and went slowly
to the top of the staircase. From there she could
hear in the stillness the words of the Episcopal
service. When she raised her head after the final
prayer, Somers saw that her cheeks were wet with
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rest here,&rdquo; she announced, dropping weakly
into a chair by the stairhead. &ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter
what I&rsquo;m sitting on,&rdquo; as Somers attempted to remove
several overcoats, evidently the overflow from the
wraps lying in the living room below. &ldquo;Bring me
the small glass of whisky which Miss Betty poured
out before she went downstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In her haste Somers neglected to add any water
and Mrs. Nash drank the whisky neat with a wry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
face. With the false strength engendered by the
stimulant, she managed to get back to her room and
into bed before her husband came upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, dear?&rdquo; he asked solicitously. &ldquo;Do
you feel stronger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now that I&rsquo;ve taken some whisky,&rdquo; promptly,
conscious that the telltale fumes might betray her
activities if questioned on the subject. &ldquo;Are the
services over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed gravely. &ldquo;Betty and I are just starting
for the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Alan Mason?&rdquo; sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is going with us, also Sheriff Trenholm. Is
there anything I can do for you before I leave,
Dora?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a thing, thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash looked across the room at Somers; she had
her back turned, while engaged in putting Mrs.
Nash&rsquo;s lingerie neatly away in the bureau drawer.
Stooping over, Nash kissed his wife with unwonted
tenderness, then, pressing her hand, hurried away
as his name was called by Alan Mason just outside
the bedroom door.</p>

<p>A room had been prepared for Somers halfway
down the corridor of the right-hand wing of the
house, and between Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s periods of dozing
the maid succeeded, with Martha Corbin&rsquo;s help,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
in arranging her belongings to her satisfaction.
Somers&rsquo; methodical mind would not permit her to
rest until her own room and that of Mrs. Nash were
in apple-pie order. Her trips back and forth took
her past Miriam Ward&rsquo;s bedroom and on her final
excursion she stumbled over Martha who, not expecting
Somers to return so quickly, had knelt down
and applied her eye to the keyhole of Miriam&rsquo;s
door.</p>

<p>The commotion aroused Miriam from fitful slumber
and, springing out of bed, she threw her dressing
gown over her shoulders and looked out into the
corridor. Somers, rising slowly to her feet, was
rubbing a rheumatic knee, while her bewildered eyes
followed Martha&rsquo;s fleeing figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; asked Miriam, noting with surprise
the scattered bundle on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Madam,&rdquo; Somers&rsquo; precision of speech and
her rising intonation clearly denoted her nationality.
&ldquo;A bit shaken,&rdquo; her smile was wintry. &ldquo;Excuse me
for disturbing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come inside,&rdquo; suggested Miriam kindly, observing
that, in spite of her disclaimer, the elderly
woman was considerably upset. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stoop over,
I will pick up what you dropped. Sit here in this
chair,&rdquo; and Somers, after a feeble protest, did as she
was told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where that woman sprung from,&rdquo;
she added, after describing what had happened.
&ldquo;My arms were full of bed linen and I wasn&rsquo;t looking
down. She&rsquo;s a bit uncanny, Miss, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam nodded absently. &ldquo;Martha is odd,&rdquo; she
admitted, as she handed a small dose of aromatic
ammonia to Somers. &ldquo;Drink this and you will feel
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss,&rdquo; exclaimed Somers gratefully,
then her mind reverted to Martha. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t
be so bad, if she wasn&rsquo;t so&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo; casting about for
a proper word to express her opinion&mdash;&ldquo;so creepy;
and those eyes of hers!&rdquo; with a shudder. &ldquo;They give
me the horrors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam smiled, not unkindly. Somers was typical
of her class&mdash;intelligent, unimaginative, a trifle garrulous
and a lover of routine, with a dislike for
anything out of the ordinary. And she had come
to Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge! Miriam&rsquo;s smile deepened.
Judging by her own experiences, the maid was
reasonably certain to encounter the unusual if she
remained long in attendance on Mrs. Nash.</p>

<p>Somers&rsquo; honest, comely face grew troubled and
she straightened up with a jerk. &ldquo;I must be getting
back to Mrs. Nash,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
Miss, I&rsquo;ll leave the linen here and put it away later
in my room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Mrs. Nash?&rdquo; asked Miriam, and the
maid paused with her hand on the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was asleep when I left her,&rdquo; responded
Somers. &ldquo;Excuse me, but aren&rsquo;t you Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; and Somers nodded sagely. &ldquo;Mrs.
Nash has told me what you have done for her. She
is very fond of you, Miss, and,&rdquo; lowering her voice,
&ldquo;Mrs. Nash can be a very good friend, as well
as&rdquo;&mdash;her voice sank to an even lower key&mdash;&ldquo;a good
hater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam eyed the maid in some perplexity. Was
her snap-judgment wrong and Somers, instead
of a staid, middle-aged Englishwoman, a lover of
romance?</p>

<p>Somers gave her no time for reflection. With a
murmured word of thanks she went into the hall and
closed the door. Miriam walked over to her bureau
and consulted her watch&mdash;nearly five o&rsquo;clock. She
was in no mood to return to bed. Pulling her dressing
gown around her, she prepared a hot bath and,
half an hour later, refreshed and invigorated, she
stood staring down at her white uniform. Should
she put it on, or her house dress? The nurse, sent
out from Washington to relieve her, would surely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
get there in time to go on night duty. If Somers
had gotten to Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge so promptly, it would
only be a matter of a few hours for the nurse to
report for duty. Miriam laid aside her clean uniform
and put on her house dress. She had completed her
toilet when Martha appeared at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Miss&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am, Doctor Roberts wishes
to see you downstairs,&rdquo; she explained, with characteristic
haste. &ldquo;Say, ain&rsquo;t them lovely?&rdquo; observing
an oddly wrought gold necklace which Miriam
slipped inside her gown. &ldquo;Rubies, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, garnets,&rdquo; shortly. Martha&rsquo;s inordinate curiosity
was an unpleasant feature. &ldquo;What were you
doing at my door a short time ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha&rsquo;s hands twisted in and out of her apron.
&ldquo;I stooped down to pick up a pin and that there
clumsy idiot flopped over me,&rdquo; she explained in an
aggrieved tone. &ldquo;Had no better sense than not to
look where she was going. She skeered me an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;I
ran downstairs.&rdquo; Her tone changed. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you come to Mr. Paul&rsquo;s funeral, Miss&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
raising her eyes and lowering them
rapidly.</p>

<p>Miriam paid not the slightest attention to the
question. Stepping past the housekeeper she went
in search of Doctor Roberts. He was sitting at the
desk in the living room, going over his daybook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Ward,&rdquo; he exclaimed as she
paused in front of him. &ldquo;I hope Martha did not
disturb you. I told her to wait until later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was all ready to come downstairs,&rdquo; she responded.
&ldquo;When will the new nurse be here? Or
did she come with you?&rdquo; glancing hopefully about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Roberts pocketed his daybook and fountain
pen. &ldquo;After your message came Miss Stockton
telephoned to every hospital and the Registry, and
not one had a nurse on call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam stared at him in dismay. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
get a nurse?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not for to-night, at least; there&rsquo;s an epidemic
of grippe and, therefore, a shortage of nurses.&rdquo;
Roberts looked at Miriam keenly. &ldquo;Are you ill,
Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; that is&rdquo;&mdash;her bitter disappointment was
discernible in her voice. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts rose and walked past the desk, stopping
by her side. &ldquo;What is it, Miss Ward?&rdquo; he asked
sympathetically. &ldquo;What has happened since this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She saw his well-cut features, broad brow, and
gray hair through a blur. His concern deepened at
sight of her evident unhappiness. &ldquo;What can I do
for you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam collected her wits. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be myself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
a minute,&rdquo; she said, brokenly. &ldquo;I had hoped to leave
the case to-night and was counting on that. I suppose,&rdquo;
looking appealingly at him, &ldquo;that you won&rsquo;t
let me off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You realize Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s condition as well as I,&rdquo;
he replied, and Miriam sighed; she had anticipated
such an answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Doctor. No&mdash;&rdquo; as the scene of the
morning rose vividly before her. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t nurse
that man&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has Nash to do with it?&rdquo; asked Roberts,
in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He denied that he was here on Monday night
with Miss Carter,&rdquo; looking straight at Roberts, &ldquo;and,
Doctor, he, a minister of the gospel, lied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; Roberts checked back the oath
with an effort. The silence lengthened as they faced
each other. Suddenly the physician turned and
paced rapidly up and down, then paused abruptly.
&ldquo;Miss Ward,&rdquo; she looked up at the seriousness of
his tone, &ldquo;you are acquainted with the ethics of our
profession. A doctor often becomes cognizant of
conditions in a home of which he cannot speak.
Alexander Nash&rsquo;s conduct,&rdquo; he paused again, &ldquo;gives
rise to doubt, and, it may be, to investigation.
I think,&rdquo; his voice deepened, &ldquo;that the quicker we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
get Mrs. Nash on her feet, the sooner will we arrive
at a solution of&mdash;many things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam drew in a long breath. &ldquo;You may be
right, Doctor,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get into my
uniform after dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a somber, silent group that drove in the
Rolls-Royce from the country cemetery to Guy
Trenholm&rsquo;s bungalow five miles distant from Upper
Marlboro. Pierre followed the sheriff&rsquo;s directions
as to crossroads with indifferent success and Betty
finally complained of the rough going and frequent
turns.</p>

<p>Trenholm lifted the speaking tube as they approached
a white gate which opened on a roadway
to a picturesque building partly concealed from the
road by a number of trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop here, Pierre,&rdquo; he directed, then turned to
the silent man by his side. &ldquo;I am greatly obliged
to you, Doctor Nash, for giving me this lift. Good
evening,&rdquo; and he sprang out of the car before the
chauffeur had brought it to a full stop. Not pausing
to exchange a word with Alan or Betty, aside from
a wave of his hat, he strode across the turf. As he
reached his front door he thrust his hand inside his
overcoat pocket for his bunch of keys and pulled
them out, and with them a folded piece of paper.</p>

<p>Trenholm stared at the paper as he thrust the key<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
in his front door, and before turning it in the lock,
paused to unfold the note. The few lines it bore
were unsigned and in an unknown handwriting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let him who hopes to solve the mystery of Paul
Abbott&rsquo;s death find the lost Paltoff jewel.</p>
</div>

<p>Trenholm&rsquo;s expression was as blank as the other
side of the paper. It was unaddressed. He reread
the note a number of times, then entered his bungalow.
The telephone was in the room he used as
library and sitting room. Hardly noticing the police
dogs that fawned upon him at his entrance, he sat
down before the telephone and quickly got his
number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, constable,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;This is Trenholm
speaking. Station a guard over the vault where
Abbott lies. What&rsquo;s that?&mdash;Oh, just a precaution,
that&rsquo;s all. Good night!&rdquo; and he hung up the
receiver.</p>

<p>Taking out his pipe and tobacco pouch, he stretched
his long legs under the table and sat back, the note
in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which one of them,&rdquo; he mused, unaware that he
spoke aloud, &ldquo;slipped this note in my overcoat
pocket?&rdquo;</p>

<span class="reduce">THE HUMAN EYE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smcap">ablo</span>, Trenholm&rsquo;s Filipino servant, brought
the after-dinner coffee into the library and
withdrew with the swiftness and silence
which characterized his movements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent coffee,&rdquo; commented Roberts. He relaxed
lazily against the cushioned sides of the big
leather chair in which he was sitting and stretched
his tired muscles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strong and black. Better
have some, Alan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Alan Mason declined. &ldquo;I am too jumpy
now,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Where the deuce is Trenholm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the kitchen talking to some man.&rdquo; The physician
put down his empty coffee cup and filled it again
from the silver pot which Pablo had thoughtfully
left on the table, with the sugar and cream. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
be back shortly, I imagine; come and sit down,&rdquo; and
with his foot he pushed around a chair, similar in
size to the one he occupied.</p>

<p>Instead of complying with his invitation, Alan
walked moodily about the room, which ran the length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
of the bungalow. Its ceiling was oak-beamed and
the windows diamond-paned, and its air of comfort
was enhanced by the good taste evidenced in its
furnishing. It was typically a man&rsquo;s room, filled
with hunting trophies, smoking paraphernalia, shotgun
and rifle, fishing rods and tackle and curious
weapons of a bygone age and other climes. Mahogany
bookshelves lined one wall and Alan stopped
and read the titles of some of the editions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scott, Thackeray, Darwin, Spencer, Dickens,
Wells, <i>et cetera</i>,&rdquo; he announced, running his finger
along the books. &ldquo;And blame me, if they don&rsquo;t look
as if he&rsquo;d read &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts turned his head to observe what Alan was
doing. &ldquo;Trenholm is one of the best informed men
in the country,&rdquo; he remarked dryly. &ldquo;He is well
read and has a brilliant mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And lives in this God-forsaken part of the country!&rdquo;
Alan shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;There is no
accounting for taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; Roberts laughed. &ldquo;But if my memory
serves me right, Alan, you are indigenous to the
soil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, but my parents had the good sense to move
to Washington soon after I was born,&rdquo; retorted
Alan. &ldquo;We spent only our summers here until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Cousin Paul Abbott bought the old place in a land
deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge is your ancestral homestead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan nodded. &ldquo;With many alterations and additions,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have known the house
when I first went to stay with Paul just before the
War. We were at Lawrenceville together, you
know, and then at Princeton.&rdquo; Alan sighed. &ldquo;The
War changed him a lot,&rdquo; he added wistfully. &ldquo;He
was a dandy pal&mdash;so much pep and devil-may-care
spirit about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was he shell-shocked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toward the last.&rdquo; Alan changed the subject
with marked abruptness. &ldquo;Say, Doctor,&rdquo; he sat
down and his voice dropped to a confidential pitch.
&ldquo;Trenholm does himself mighty well&mdash;this most
attractive bungalow, a model farm, and a servant
whose cooking is absolutely faultless. Where does
he get the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His salary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan laughed mirthlessly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t much
more than pay Pablo&rsquo;s wages,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It takes
real money to keep up a place like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts lighted a cigar, first offering one to Alan,
which the latter accepted, with a word of thanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard some time ago that a rich relation&mdash;one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
of the Trenholms of South Carolina&mdash;died and left
Guy a handsome legacy, which he has augmented by
careful investments,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Alan was having some difficulty in lighting
his cigar. &ldquo;Who told you that&mdash;Trenholm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe so. Why?&rdquo; His question met with
no response and Roberts eyed his companion in
speculative silence.</p>

<p>Alan&rsquo;s complexion was not a healthy color, the
physician decided in his own mind, and the unsteadiness
of his hand as he strove to hold a match to his
cigar was not lost on Roberts. The older man&rsquo;s expression
grew thoughtful; Alan Mason had changed
in the past few days and not for the best. Roberts
had observed his tendency to go off alone for long
walks, and his sudden bursts of talkativeness at the
table and his equally abrupt lapses into long, sullen
silence from which no one could arouse him.</p>

<p>It was in such a fit of depression that Roberts had
encountered him when about to motor over to Trenholm&rsquo;s
for dinner, and he had persuaded Alan to
accompany him after the latter had first called up
Trenholm and received a hearty invitation to make
one of the party. All through dinner Alan had chatted
on first one topic and then another, the others
seconding his efforts, but the three men with one
accord avoided any reference to the tragedy at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge or to the funeral which had taken
place that afternoon.</p>

<p>Trenholm found his two guests smoking in silence
when he joined them a few minutes later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have been so long,&rdquo; he said apologetically,
taking up a cup of coffee, before seating himself
on the divan before the open fire. &ldquo;There have
been a number of petty thefts in the neighborhood,
but I believe we&rsquo;ve jailed the right man to-day, from
the evidence just brought to me.&rdquo; He swallowed his
coffee and replaced the cup on the table. &ldquo;By the
way, Roberts, how is Mrs. Nash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better this evening,&rdquo; responded Roberts.
&ldquo;If she continues to show such improvement, she
may be able to sit up to-morrow for a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then Mrs. Nash can soon dispense with the
services of a trained nurse,&rdquo; broke in Alan, with a
swift look upward at the clock on the mantel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Roberts. &ldquo;Much depends,
however, on what sort of a night she has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Ward still on the case?&rdquo; questioned
Trenholm, knocking the ashes from his pipe before
refilling it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Roberts puffed silently at his cigar for a
few seconds. &ldquo;I tried to get another nurse to relieve
her, but none were disengaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Miss Ward told you she wished to go?&rdquo; with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
a quiet persistence which made Roberts glance at the
sheriff in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wondered if she would attempt to leave after
all,&rdquo; responded Trenholm. &ldquo;I warned her that she
was wanted here until after the inquest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wanted?&rdquo; Alan dropped the cigar from his
nervous fingers and hastily stooped to pick it up.
When he sat back his face was flushed. &ldquo;Wanted&mdash;for
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As chief witness. Hello, who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;&mdash;as the
knocker on the front door sounded in three hurried
blows.</p>

<p>Pablo, busy in clearing off the dining room table,
scurried into the hall and the murmur of voices
sounded first faintly and then came distinctly to their
ears. The three men gazed blankly at each other
as Pablo pulled back the portières.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mees Carter,&rdquo; he announced and discreetly
vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; Alan was the first on his feet. &ldquo;Why
are you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s glance swept by him to Roberts and then
to her host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to see you, Guy Trenholm,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Why have you put a guard around the vault where
Paul lies?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>As she came further into the library, the men saw
that the hem of her short walking suit and her high
boots were splashed with mud. Trenholm pulled
back a chair and stepped toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that his grave will not be molested,&rdquo; he replied
quietly. &ldquo;There are ghouls who, attracted by the
newspaper accounts of Paul&rsquo;s tragic death, would not
hesitate to enter the vault if given an opportunity.
You have been there to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is obvious,&rdquo; with a glance at her muddy
condition and the smart walking stick which she
carried. Her hair, naturally curly, showed under
the brim of her sport hat, and her cheeks were rosy
from the cold night air. But to Trenholm&rsquo;s keen
vision, there was a strained look about her eyes, a
continuous twitching of her hands which betrayed
nerves keyed to the highest tension. &ldquo;Doctor Roberts,&rdquo;
she turned impulsively to the older man,
ignoring Alan, &ldquo;has Sheriff Trenholm told you his
theory of the murder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts looked from her to Trenholm. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
replied, and would have added more, but Trenholm
cut in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not discussed my theories with any one,&rdquo;
he said smoothly. &ldquo;But your suggestion is a good
one. Sit here,&rdquo; dragging forward a chair, &ldquo;and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
will talk the situation over. Doctor Roberts, you
and Alan&mdash;and perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;his smile was enigmatic.
He did not complete his sentence, but waited
patiently for Betty to seat herself.</p>

<p>With a swift glance about her she mastered her
hesitation&mdash;her inclination to run away. She had
come there with a purpose, and until that was accomplished&mdash;her
fingers clenched about her stick; it
required all her self-control not to strike the tall man
at her elbow. He dwarfed her in size, but the
smoldering resentment in her eyes flamed up as he
bent toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do sit down,&rdquo; repeated Trenholm with gentle
insistence. &ldquo;Take your old chair, Roberts,&rdquo; and he
dropped into one next the physician as Alan and
Betty followed his example. &ldquo;Now, Miss Carter&mdash;&rdquo;
he prompted.</p>

<p>Betty glanced at him for a fraction of a second,
then her gaze swept the library. It was the first
time she had ever been in Trenholm&rsquo;s house. Slowly
her eyes traveled about the room, noting each object,
until finally her gaze rested on a large silver frame
standing on the big mahogany table. It was one she
had given to Trenholm in Paris. She caught her
breath slightly&mdash;the frame was empty. She suddenly
grew conscious of the concentrated regard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
her companions and involuntarily her glance sought
Alan, sitting across from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Betty, we are waiting,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the sheriff,&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;Come, sir, do
not keep us longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm took out a cigarette case and offered it
to Betty, but she waved it away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take some
coffee,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Thanks, Alan,&rdquo; as he filled a cup
for her. Again she turned to Trenholm. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we reconstruct the scene on Monday
night,&rdquo; began Trenholm slowly. &ldquo;Roberts turns
Paul over to his trained nurse and leaves. Corbin
and his wife go to bed, and Miss Ward is alone with
her patient....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; asked Alan, bending forward, his
eyes fastened on Betty, who sat sipping her coffee.
Trenholm answered his question with another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do we know of Miss Ward?&rdquo; he asked,
and Roberts stared at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know of her?&rdquo; the physician repeated. &ldquo;She
was sent on the case by Central Registry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about her antecedents?&rdquo; questioned
Trenholm. &ldquo;Where did she spring from? Is she a
Washingtonian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said not,&rdquo; replied Roberts. &ldquo;She told me
that she had trained in New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know nothing more of her than that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t even know that she was not acquainted
with Paul before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Roberts&rsquo; eyes opened as well as his
mouth. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;they were strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, were they?&rdquo; with quiet emphasis. &ldquo;Can you
prove it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts shook his head. &ldquo;No; but judging from
her manner she had never met Paul before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women are clever actresses,&rdquo; retorted Trenholm.
&ldquo;Well, Miss Ward, who may or who may not have
known Paul before, is the last person known to have
been with him on the night he was murdered&mdash;the
last person to have seen him alive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; the interruption came from Alan. He
was not looking at Betty, but kept his eyes steadfastly
lowered, the cigar still in his hand. &ldquo;Miss
Ward claims that Paul had visitors&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Ward&rsquo;s statements as to their presence
have not been substantiated&rdquo;&mdash;Trenholm paused and
Betty could not avoid his stare&mdash;&ldquo;as yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the lengthening silence Betty&rsquo;s rapid breathing
was faintly audible. She finished her coffee and her
hand was quite steady as she set the cup and saucer
down on a stool by her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And your theory is&mdash;what?&rdquo; she asked, raising
her eyes to Trenholm&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Miss Ward killed Paul while he slept,&rdquo;
replied the sheriff.</p>

<p>Alan drew out his handkerchief and wiped his
forehead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rotten theory!&rdquo; he exploded.
&ldquo;Why, Trenholm, I thought you liked Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty shot a swift glance at Trenholm and her
figure grew rigid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a matter of like or dislike,&rdquo; replied
Trenholm quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of finding Paul&rsquo;s
murderer. You asked me for a theory&mdash;and mine
is a reasonable hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; broke in Roberts. &ldquo;Paul was
no slight weight. I doubt if Miss Ward could have
lifted him in and out of bed unassisted, especially
putting him back in bed&mdash;a dead body is an unwieldy
object.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could have killed him in bed,&rdquo; replied Trenholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the other night you pointed out to Miss
Ward and me that the lack of bloodstains on the
sheets proved the crime was not committed in
the bed,&rdquo; objected Alan heatedly.</p>

<p>Trenholm eyed him thoughtfully. &ldquo;You forget
Miss Ward is a nurse,&rdquo; he pointed out slowly. &ldquo;It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
would be a simple matter for her to change the bed
linen with the dead man lying in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty leaned forward in her earnestness. &ldquo;And
what became of the bloodstained sheets?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Trenholm uncrossed his long legs and leaned
closer to her chair. &ldquo;Ask Corbin,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s grasp of her walking stick tightened, and
she grew conscious of the atmosphere of the overheated
room. Turning from Trenholm&rsquo;s direct gaze
she saw Alan fumbling with his collar, his face a
pasty white, and she seized her opportunity to divert
attention from herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ill, Alan?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes big with
concern. &ldquo;Doctor, can&rsquo;t we have some fresh air in
the room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts threw up the window nearest to him,
then went to Alan&rsquo;s aid. Alan took the flask Trenholm
proffered and drank eagerly, putting it down
almost empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The room&rsquo;s infernally
hot. Say, Guy,&rdquo; turning impulsively to
him, &ldquo;your theory&rsquo;s no good. What possible motive
could Miss Ward have had to kill Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;&mdash;there was something
disarming about Trenholm&rsquo;s smile and Alan&rsquo;s anger
cooled. &ldquo;Miss Carter asked for a theory and I gave
her one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Betty shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Which won&rsquo;t
hold water.&rdquo; Her voice altered and her companions
gathered a hint of pent-up passion as she added, in
tones which she strove to steady, &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s murder was
no motiveless crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; agreed Trenholm. &ldquo;And that motive
was what, Miss Carter?&rdquo; He waited in vain for an
answer, and finally broke the pause. &ldquo;Paul apparently
had no enemies, and yet he was killed,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Come, Roberts, you&rsquo;ve known and loved the
boy for years; you, Alan, were his first cousin and
chum; Miss Carter, his,&rdquo; he paused, and she looked
at him dumbly, &ldquo;his one love. Among you, can you
not tell the motive which inspired Paul&rsquo;s murder&mdash;was
it hate, was it revenge, was it greed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His deep voice lingered on the last word, then
ceased. Roberts had touched him on the arm. At
a sign from the physician Trenholm, without moving,
turned his head and glanced at the open window.
The light from one of the lamps shone directly on
the outer blind. It had been turned a crack and
in it peered a human eye.</p>

<p>With a spring which carried him halfway across
the room, Trenholm gained the hall and threw
open the front door, his police dogs at his heels.
They swept by him and raced around the house and
down the driveway, the sheriff and Roberts behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
them. As the dogs gave tongue, a strong, powerful
voice called Trenholm&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call off your dogs, Trenholm!&rdquo; And turning
his flashlight on the newcomer, the sheriff recognized
Alexander Nash, the Rolls-Royce standing down the
roadside.</p>

<p>In the library Betty turned aside from her feverish
scanning of Trenholm&rsquo;s papers on the table, to find
Alan standing, with his back partly turned, drinking
the remaining whisky out of the flask. Betty was
by his side in an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, Alan; you mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she pleaded, real
terror in her handsome eyes. &ldquo;You promised
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexander Nash&rsquo;s heavy tread, as he and Roberts
entered the room, caused her to swing swiftly in
their direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your aunt was alarmed by your absence, Betty,&rdquo;
explained Nash, and his voice sounded loudly in the
sudden stillness. &ldquo;She learned of your trip to
the cemetery and sent me to bring you home.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">iriam Ward</span> opened the window a
little further and looked out. It was
nearly midnight and the cold, raw breeze
was an agreeable contrast to the atmosphere of the
sick room. Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s preparations for the night
were long-drawn-out and Miriam had found her at
her worst. In turn she waxed dictatorial, fault-finding
and fretful, and Miriam&rsquo;s stock of patience was
severely taxed. It seemed an interminable time
before Mrs. Nash finally closed her eyes with the
avowed intention of taking &ldquo;forty winks,&rdquo; and
the imperative command that she be awakened the
moment her husband returned.</p>

<p>Miriam made herself as comfortable as possible
on the window seat, having carried a sofa pillow
with her, and pulling her sweater more closely over
her shoulders, she leaned her head against the
wooden sash and stared out into the night. The
stars were out and the moonlight added beauty to
the grounds. It all appeared so calm and peaceful,
so utterly different from the last four hectic days.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Miriam sighed involuntarily and closed her eyes.
When she opened them a few minutes later she saw
the powerful headlights of a car coming along the
turnpike. A second later it had swung into
the driveway and Miriam recognized the Rolls-Royce.
The front door was toward the other side
of the house, and Miriam lost sight of the car as it
circled the approach to the <i>porte cochère</i>. Undoubtedly
Doctor Nash had returned.</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s expression hardened. Her outspoken,
frank disposition made it next to impossible for her
to cloak her aversion even under the ordinary courtesies
of the sick room. She was commencing to
loathe Doctor Nash; while wondering dimly why
two such opposite natures as Dora Carter and the
clergyman had ever fallen in love with each other.
Truly, the marriage market was but a lottery!</p>

<p>Leaving her position by the window, Miriam
walked softly over to the bed. Her patient&rsquo;s deep
breathing assured her that Mrs. Nash was comfortably
asleep and Miriam&rsquo;s heart lightened; she would
not have to summon Doctor Nash, for, in spite of
his wife&rsquo;s wishes, Miriam did not propose to awaken
her. The closing of a door further down the hall
with a resounding bang brought her hand to her
heart and Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s eyes unclosed in time to
notice Miriam&rsquo;s agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that noise?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;What
has happened to make you so pale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;it&rsquo;s the lamplight,&rdquo; Miriam stammered
a trifle incoherently. &ldquo;A door slammed and
startled me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash rubbed her eyes and inspected her
with interest. Miriam&rsquo;s trig uniform was becoming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nerves,&rdquo; Mrs. Nash remarked caustically.
&ldquo;Have you seen Doctor Nash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has just returned and I believe is still downstairs,&rdquo;
responded Miriam. &ldquo;But, Mrs. Nash, you
should not see any one at this hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! My nap has refreshed me, and besides,
I am stronger, much stronger,&rdquo; with emphasis, and
she struggled into a sitting position. &ldquo;Just throw
that bed sacque over my shoulders and ask Doctor
Nash to come here, there&rsquo;s a good child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s hesitation was interrupted by a low tap
on the bedroom door, and walking swiftly over to it
she found Doctor Roberts standing in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am on my way to bed,&rdquo; he said, softly. &ldquo;How
is Mrs. Nash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her general condition is better now.&rdquo; Miriam
slipped outside and held the door so that their voices
would not carry into the bedroom. &ldquo;But when I
came on duty I found her cyanosed, so I gave her
stimulation and applied heat locally.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>Doctor Roberts stroked his chin thoughtfully, then
moved toward the door and Miriam held it open.
Mrs. Nash greeted him with a frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some more horrid medicine,&rdquo; she grumbled.
&ldquo;Well, all paths lead to the grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cheerful outlook,&rdquo; smiled Roberts as he took
her pulse. &ldquo;You ought to be asleep at this hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never felt more wakeful,&rdquo; and Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
alert look confirmed her words. &ldquo;Where have you
been all the evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Sheriff Trenholm&rsquo;s&mdash;Alan Mason and I dined
with Trenholm, and your husband drove us back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was he doing there?&rdquo; The look which
she flashed at him startled the physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had come for Betty Carter, having missed
her at the cemetery,&rdquo; replied Roberts. He was commencing
to feel uncomfortable under Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
steady stare. Quickly he rose to forestall other
questions. &ldquo;We returned together a few minutes
ago. Now, Mrs. Nash, it is after midnight and you
must get to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;As you go to your
room, Doctor, please ask Alex to come here. I shall
not sleep until I have seen my husband,&rdquo; and her air
of finality closed the discussion. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts smiled at her characteristic dismissal. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
the door he turned to Miriam and signed to her to
come into the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humor her as much as possible,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;When she gets her own way, she&rsquo;ll go to sleep. Her
pulse is better and she has no temperature. I&rsquo;ll send
Nash along,&rdquo; and with a friendly smile he hurried
downstairs.</p>

<p>Miriam had just given Mrs. Nash a drink of water
when the clergyman came in. Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s sharp,
black eyes detected his constrained manner as he
spoke to Miriam and her equally stiff acknowledgment
of his greeting. Turning her back upon Nash,
Miriam addressed his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wait in the alcove in the hall until your
husband leaves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you wish anything,
please let me know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash remained standing until the hall door closed
behind Miriam and then he seated himself in a chair
by his wife&rsquo;s bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so thankful that you are better, Dora,&rdquo; he
said, taking her hand in both his and raising it to his
lips. &ldquo;So very, very thankful to a merciful Providence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save some of your thanks for Miss Ward,&rdquo; she
remarked dryly. &ldquo;She gave Providence a helping
hand. By the way, you don&rsquo;t seem to like her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Dora!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she persisted, ignoring his interjection.</p>

<p>Nash sighed. Custom had taught him respect for
his wife&rsquo;s tenacity, but there were times when he
wanted to shake her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She, eh&mdash;reh&mdash;has an agreeable personality,&rdquo; he
began. &ldquo;I am grateful to her for what she has done
for you, but I, eh, really, my dear, haven&rsquo;t given her
much thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Nash squirmed uneasily under her unswerving
gaze. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Nash, and her
intonation conveyed much or little according to
her husband&rsquo;s perception. &ldquo;And Betty, where is
she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rapid change of topic confused Nash, his
slower wits failing to keep up with his wife&rsquo;s trend
of thought. &ldquo;She is downstairs,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;That
is, I left her there talking to Alan and Roberts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She ought to be in bed,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Nash,
with ill-concealed irritability. &ldquo;Traipsing around the
countryside by herself at night. Did she reach
the cemetery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Nash cleared his throat. &ldquo;The attendant
at the vault told me that she had gone to Trenholm&rsquo;s,
two miles the other side of the cemetery; so Pierre
drove me there and I brought her home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash looked down at the old-fashioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
handmade quilt and studied its pattern and cross
stitch intently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty is a great responsibility,&rdquo; she said, glancing
over at her husband. &ldquo;Her eccentric conduct, her
total lack of thought for others&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is young,&rdquo; broke in Nash with some vehemence
and his wife changed color. &ldquo;And youth is
selfish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that were all&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Nash spoke under her
breath and her husband failed to catch what she
said. He did not care to break the pause and, as the
silence lengthened, Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s thoughts reverted to
the past.</p>

<p>Alexander Nash did not appear a day older than
the first time she had met him in London two years
before. The fact that he was again clean-shaven
accounted for his unaltered appearance, his wife
decided. She had never cared for his carefully
trimmed beard and mustache which he had worn
until a day or so before. A flood of memories of
the days of their courtship, their marriage in Paris
and their happy, happy honeymoon kept Mrs. Nash
silent. A year and six months had passed since then.
Mrs. Nash bit her lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a romantic old fool,&rdquo; she admitted, and her
usually metallic tones had softened, holding a depth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
of feeling which would have startled her skeptic
friends. &ldquo;Kiss me, Alec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From where she sat in the hall Miriam caught now
and then the sound of voices from the living room on
the floor below, and recognized Betty&rsquo;s clear tones
and Roberts&rsquo; heavier bass, with now and then a word
from Alan Mason. But from Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom
no sound issued and she waited patiently in her corner
for Doctor Nash to take his departure. Footsteps
on the staircase caused her to draw further
back in the alcove; she was in no mood to talk to
any member of the house party that night. Was
&ldquo;house party&rdquo; the proper term when tragedy had
brought them together under the same roof? With
a shake of her head Miriam dismissed the question
as Betty came up the steps, followed by Roberts. On
reaching the second floor she paused and spoke to
the physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot sleep,&rdquo; Miriam heard her say. &ldquo;Indeed,
Doctor, I cannot sleep, and another night like the
last three will drive me to madness. Can&rsquo;t you give
me something to induce sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts scanned her closely. Betty&rsquo;s broken voice,
her quivering lips which she strove vainly to keep
steady, were both unmistakable symptoms of her
overwrought condition. Roberts had marveled at
her self-control during their drive homeward, unexpectedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
delayed by a puncture which had taken
Pierre over an hour to repair. Nash&rsquo;s wrath at the
chauffeur for not having a spare tire along had added
a picturesque moment to the monotony of the trip.
It was the first time Roberts had seen the generally
self-contained clergyman give way to temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get ready for bed, Betty,&rdquo; Roberts advised, &ldquo;and
I will ask Miss Ward to prepare a sedative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty checked him with an expressive gesture.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give it to me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&mdash;I dislike
to&mdash;to ask Miss Ward for&mdash;for&mdash;to do anything,&rdquo;
she spoke through chattering teeth. &ldquo;I believe
I am having a chill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts laid a firm hand on her arm. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
he said in tones which his patients rarely disobeyed.
&ldquo;Go immediately to bed. I will find Miss Ward to
assist you; now, no nonsense,&rdquo; as she paused to
voice another objection. &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam emerged from the alcove as Roberts, after
conducting Betty to her bedroom door, came down
the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Nash is with his wife,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I have been sitting yonder and could not help but
overhear your conversation with Miss Carter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is on the point of a breakdown,&rdquo; Roberts
said tersely. &ldquo;Is your hypodermic ready for use?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then please come to Miss Carter&rsquo;s bedroom: I
will meet you there in a few minutes,&rdquo; and taking her
acquiescence for granted Roberts hurried to his
own room where he had left his bag.</p>

<p>Miriam paused in indecision; she had been
trained to serve humanity&mdash;to care for the sick and
to look after the infirm. Was it obligatory upon
her to minister to Betty now that she was ill? No,
a thousand times, no! From somewhere came the
chimes of a clock&mdash;one in the morning&mdash;Doctor
Roberts was powerless to secure other aid in a sick
room at that hour and twenty miles from Washington.
Miriam walked quietly to her room, where she
had her hypodermic syringe, secured it and went
direct to Betty. Alexander Nash would find her if
she was needed by his wife.</p>

<p>Betty looked up at her approach and Miriam was
struck by the suffering in her face. In her haste
to undress and get into bed she had scattered her
clothes on the floor and she had kept on her dressing
gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
she paused, at a loss for words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Roberts will be here in a moment,&rdquo;
answered Miriam quietly. Putting down her hypodermic,
she spent the next few minutes arranging
the room and adjusting the windows. Betty never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
took her eyes from her and Miriam was thankful
when Roberts knocked on the closed door.</p>

<p>Silently Miriam aided him in his examination and
her swift deftness won his admiration. As he took
the thermometer from Betty Miriam observed a gold
chain suspended about her neck. She caught
Miriam&rsquo;s glance and drew her dressing gown close
about her throat.</p>

<p>Miriam prepared the hypodermic, then paused by
Roberts&rsquo; side. &ldquo;Will you give it?&rdquo; she said simply,
holding the instrument toward the physician, and
Roberts grasped her reluctance to administer the
opiate.</p>

<p>No one in the room was aware that the door had
been cautiously opened an inch or two and then as
quietly closed. Alan Mason reached the staircase a
minute later and stood listening, his head bent. Only
the faint tick-tock of the grandfather clock was to
be heard. Convinced that he was alone in the hall
he made his way noiselessly to the door of the room
where Paul Abbott&rsquo;s body had lain until the funeral
that afternoon. The door was locked. Alan drew
in his breath sharply, hitched at his dark sweater,
and glanced down at his &ldquo;sneakers&rdquo;; then he crept
softly through the darkness of the back hall and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Roberts looked over at Miriam and then at Betty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
as he rose and tiptoed to the door. &ldquo;She will be all
right, now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you have an opportunity,
come in again during the night.&rdquo; He paused and,
to Miriam&rsquo;s surprise, held out his hand. &ldquo;Thank
you. Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam delayed only a few seconds to adjust the
light so that it would not shine directly in Betty&rsquo;s
eyes and awaken her, and then she left the room.
She had almost reached her old seat in the alcove,
and was debating in her mind whether or not to
go at once into Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s room, when her patient&rsquo;s
door swung open and Doctor Nash appeared in the
hall. He looked relieved to find her there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I waited until my wife dropped asleep,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You can go in now, but pray don&rsquo;t disturb her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam bit her lip to keep back a heated rejoinder.
Instructions in nursing from members of the patient&rsquo;s
family, irrespective as to who they were, were
generally infuriating, but, from Alexander Nash,
doubly so. He evidently expected no answer, for
turning abruptly, he sought his bedroom.</p>

<p>Nash had not only lowered the lamp before leaving
his wife, but had placed a screen about it&mdash;however
Miriam&rsquo;s familiarity with the room enabled
her to move about without colliding with the furniture.
The cot did not appeal to her&mdash;she felt, as
she had once expressed it to a fellow student at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the hospital when in training, too &ldquo;twitchy&rdquo; to lie
down. Going over to the chair which Nash had
occupied, she sat down in it. It was not the one
which customarily stood near the bed, but another
chair, bigger and much lower, and Miriam experienced
a sense of sudden shock as she dropped down
further than she had expected.</p>

<p>It was a chair built for a large man and Miriam
felt lost in its depths and squirmed back, hoping
to find an easier position, but that made her stretch
her legs before her at an uncomfortable angle. Too
tired to get up, she put her hand behind her and
pulled up the seat cushion. As she did so, she
touched a paper&mdash;evidently a letter, she judged, as
she ran her fingers over what was unmistakably an
envelope with stamps upon it. Half rising she
turned around and bending down saw that a letter
was wedged between the high, tufted cushion and
the upholstered back of the chair. In idle curiosity,
Miriam took it up, replaced the cushion, and carried
the letter over to the lamp. The orange Canadian
stamps caught her attention instantly. She turned
it over. The black seal was unbroken, the flap uncut&mdash;the
letter evidently never had been opened.</p>

<p>Miriam drew a long, long breath. Turning, she
gazed at the chair. Its unwieldy size had induced
her to push it behind the bedroom door the first night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
of Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s illness, to get it out of the way.
Evidently Doctor Nash had preferred it to the one
in which she generally sat, and had moved it up to
the bed. Had he accidentally dropped the letter
in the chair and not perceived it when leaving the
darkened room? Miriam consulted the postmark
and then the address. It bore Paul Abbott&rsquo;s name
and was dated January 23, 1923.</p>

<p>Miriam stood in deep thought holding the unopened
letter, then she slipped it inside her uniform,
made sure that it was safe, and, crossing the room,
seated herself once more by Mrs. Nash, her mind
in a turmoil.</p>

<p>It was close upon three o&rsquo;clock in the morning
when Mrs. Nash awoke and called Miriam by name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so thirsty,&rdquo; she complained, as the girl bent
over her. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I have some orange juice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; and Miriam went over to the table
on which she kept her supplies. The oranges were
there, but hunt as she might, she could find no knife.
With a few uncomplimentary comments on Martha&rsquo;s
carelessness in neglecting to bring her one when she
carried her night lunch upstairs, Miriam hastened
down to the pantry, after a brief word of explanation
to Mrs. Nash.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash could see from her position in the
bed the hall door which Miriam had left ajar; from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
there her gaze shifted to the lighted lamp at the
farther end of the room, and then she closed her
eyes. When she opened them the bedroom was in
darkness.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Nash lay speechless with surprise, she
grew conscious that some one beside herself was
in the room, and a faint, scraping noise sounded
closer and closer to the bed. Suddenly something
soft brushed across the back of her hand lying on
the edge of her bed. Turning her hand over with
lightning speed, her fingers closed spasmodically
upon some object, and a cry escaped her.</p>

<p>Miriam, halfway up the stairs, covered the distance
to her bedroom with flying feet as the low
cry came to her ears. She faltered in consternation
at sight of the utter darkness. Mrs. Nash caught
sight of her white uniform as she stood in the doorway,
outlined by the light behind her in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring in the lamp,&rdquo; she directed, unaware that
her voice was hoarse from excitement, and Miriam
obeyed her instantly. When she reached the bedside,
Mrs. Nash was leaning upon her elbow, a false
beard suspended from her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost got him,&rdquo; she exclaimed in triumph,
then fainted quietly away.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE WILL OF HATE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">octor Roberts</span> leaned back in his
chair and stared at Guy Trenholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, Paul, poor lad, was stabbed with
that vicious-looking nut pick,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pointing
to where it lay on the table in the sunparlor of
Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge. &ldquo;And Mrs. Nash was awakened
last night by a disguised man and succeeded in
dragging off his false beard. Upon my word&mdash;what
next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men, with Alan Mason, looking wretchedly
ill, making a poor third in their conversation,
were waiting patiently for the arrival from Washington
of the lawyer employed by Paul Abbott,
who had signified his intention of reaching there at
ten o&rsquo;clock. It was then eleven, as Alan&rsquo;s frequent
glances at his watch assured him, and his nervousness
was increasing. He looked up furtively at
Roberts at the latter&rsquo;s question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Mrs. Nash recognize the man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Roberts shook his head. &ldquo;She said she was unable
to make out if it was a man or a woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; Alan dropped the penknife with
which he was fiddling and half rose. &ldquo;<i>A woman?</i>
Why, that&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s beard in your hand, Guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a woman could have disguised herself with
it, as well as a man,&rdquo; Trenholm said. &ldquo;Odd, isn&rsquo;t
it, that something always happens to Miss Ward&rsquo;s
patients when she is on duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, why are you forever picking on
her!&rdquo; Alan dropped back in his chair and his voice
rang out indignantly, reaching the ears of Betty
Carter, who was eating a belated breakfast in the
dining room.</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s violent start was not lost on Martha, and
the housekeeper decided to remain in the room under
pretext of rearranging the silver in the drawer. But
first she handed a plate of toast to Betty and as the
girl took a slice she encountered the unfriendly stare
of Martha&rsquo;s oddly assorted eyes and an involuntary
shiver ran down her spine. Her attention distracted,
Betty failed to distinguish any reply to Alan&rsquo;s fervid
question and, not having heard Trenholm&rsquo;s remark
which had called it forth, she was in doubt to whom
the &ldquo;her&rdquo; referred. Who was Guy Trenholm &ldquo;picking
on&rdquo; now? She longed to steal to the closed portières
and overhear what was being said, but Martha&rsquo;s
presence kept her in her seat.</p>

<p>The opiate had given her needed sleep and Betty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
felt more like her old self once again. Against the
advice of Somers, Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s maid, who had gone
early to inquire how she was, she had insisted
upon getting up and coming downstairs. Somers had
regaled her, while in the process of assisting her
to dress, with a dramatic account of Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
adventures that night&mdash;and they lost nothing in the
telling. Betty&rsquo;s rapt attention would have inspired
an even less imaginative person to thrilling heights
of fancy. A burst of tears relieved the tension of
Betty&rsquo;s overtaxed nervous system and reduced Somers
to contrite silence. Had not Doctor Roberts as
well as Miss Ward cautioned her not to excite Miss
Betty? Somers&rsquo; confused state of mind was not
lessened by Betty&rsquo;s reception of a piece of news
which the maid let drop incautiously&mdash;the expected
arrival of Daniel Corcoran, for many years attorney
and close friend of the elder Abbott and the legal
adviser of the latter&rsquo;s son. Betty&rsquo;s feverish desire to
dress and have her breakfast downstairs took away
Somers&rsquo; breath and she retired thankfully, a short
time later, to the comparative tranquillity of Mrs.
Nash&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>

<p>Unaware of Betty&rsquo;s presence in the dining room
Roberts and Trenholm continued their low-voiced
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you made tests for fingerprints on the nut
pick, Trenholm?&ldquo; inquired Roberts.</p>

<p>The sheriff nodded. &ldquo;An expert came down from
Washington,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Aside from the bloodstains,
there were no marks upon it. Evidently the
person using it&rdquo;&mdash;Trenholm held up the nut pick
in its wrapping of oil silk as he spoke and then
placed it carefully in the inside pocket of his coat&mdash;&ldquo;wore
gloves. As a means of identification the bit
of steel is a failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ingenious weapon,&rdquo; commented Roberts.
&ldquo;And Paul&rsquo;s pyjamas&rsquo; jacket offered no resistance.
It would not have required great strength to drive
the pick into a vital part of his body&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again,&rdquo; objected Alan, &ldquo;insinuating
the murder was committed by a woman. Say, you
are a great sheriff, you are!&rdquo; turning in sudden, unlooked-for
wrath to the big man lounging near him.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do something besides loaf around
this place? I believe you were here last night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was I?&rdquo; Trenholm&rsquo;s calm smile was provoking
in its hint of bored amusement. Was the sheriff
poking fun at him? The thought was intolerable,
and Alan jerked uneasily about and finally rose and
strolled over to one of the glass doors leading to
the garden. &ldquo;Well, this appears to be the place a
sheriff is needed, Alan. First the cold-blooded murder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
of a defenseless man,&rdquo; his voice rose slightly&mdash;&ldquo;then
a housebreaker last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deuce take it!&rdquo; Roberts straightened up and
laid down his cigar. &ldquo;Something must be done,
Trenholm; Alan&rsquo;s right. Why not try one of the
well-known detective agencies?&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I may, shortly,&rdquo; Trenholm rejoined in
the same unemotional tones. &ldquo;I am always open to
suggestions. Have you any more, Alan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan&rsquo;s white cheeks turned a more healthy color
and leaving the window he came closer to Trenholm;
stopped, opened his mouth to speak, hesitated, then
moved over to the portières. Parting them slightly
he gazed into the dining room. It was vacant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Guy;&rdquo; he had regained Trenholm&rsquo;s side
and spoke hurriedly, clipping his words together.
&ldquo;What about Corbin? Have you thought of him
as a&mdash;a&mdash;possible suspect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm stared up at his agitated questioner for
a moment in silence. &ldquo;Corbin tells an apparently
straight tale, Alan,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He declares that
after admitting Miss Ward on Monday evening he
and Martha retired to their rooms and slept soundly
all night. Their quarters, as you know, are near
the roof and at the back of the house. No ordinary
sound would carry that distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by an ordinary sound?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Roberts, who was following the rapid dialogue with
deep attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A door bell, for instance,&rdquo; responded Trenholm,
with a quick glance at Alan.</p>

<p>Alan looked away for an instant. &ldquo;How about a
sound <i>out</i> of the ordinary?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;A cry
of terror&mdash;of horror&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t that reach them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm shook his head dubiously. &ldquo;Not with
their doors closed. And Martha substantiates her
husband&rsquo;s statement that they are both heavy sleepers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Martha!&rdquo; Alan tossed down his hat which
he had picked up and held aimlessly, twirling it
back and forth. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t believe her on oath&mdash;neither
of them, for that matter. Why under heaven
Paul kept the Corbins here after his father&rsquo;s death
I cannot imagine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly because he deemed them faithful,&rdquo; replied
Trenholm dryly. &ldquo;You must also recollect
that it is difficult to induce servants to live out here
in the country all the year round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan, silenced but not convinced, walked sulkily
across the sunparlor and threw himself into a wicker
chair. &ldquo;The Washington papers are still featuring
the murder,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a newspaper lying
on the floor with a headline running half across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
the front page. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of heading off the reporters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send them to me,&rdquo; suggested Trenholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; disgust spoke in Alan&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;They call
you the fresh water clam of Prince Georges County.
You&rsquo;ve got their goat by your uncommunicative
ways and rotten bad manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm looked across at Roberts. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t appear
to be popular,&rdquo; he remarked, a faint twinkle
in his eye, and changed the subject. &ldquo;Will you throw
me that false beard, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts handed it to him. &ldquo;Any clue in that,
Trenholm?&rdquo; he asked, watching the sheriff stow it
carefully away in his coat pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe. I&rsquo;ve only had it in my possession for
the past hour.&rdquo; The wicker chair in which Trenholm
was seated creaked under his weight as he
straightened up from his lounging position, preparatory
to rising. &ldquo;When can I interview Mrs. Nash,
Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This afternoon, I imagine,&rdquo; answered Roberts.
&ldquo;I saw her before breakfast and she seems none
the worse for her fright last night. Her husband
insisted that I remain through the morning, however,
in case I was needed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm looked around at Alan. &ldquo;What has
become of Nash?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea,&rdquo; roughly. &ldquo;I keep
out of his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The question shot from Trenholm and
Roberts glanced at him, his interest instantly aroused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the type I can&rsquo;t stand&mdash;oily, unctuous, bah!&rdquo;
Alan&rsquo;s temper had gained the upper hand. &ldquo;A pious
fraud!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What reply his companions would have made, he
never learned, for at that moment the portières were
pulled aside to admit the lawyer from Washington.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Cocoron&rdquo; was the best Pierre could
do in pronouncing the name of Corcoran. The
chauffeur had taken it upon himself to usher the
lawyer into the house in the absence of Martha
Corbin, the newcomer having rung the front door
bell at the moment Pierre was alone in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Daniel Corcoran had known Alan Mason since his
boyhood, Doctor Roberts was his family physician,
and Guy Trenholm he had met numerous times when
visiting Paul Abbott, Senior. The lawyer&rsquo;s usual
cheery smile was absent as he shook hands with
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a shocking affair!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shocking!
Paul was a fine young man, with a brilliant career
ahead of him. I cannot conceive of any one harboring
enmity against him; he was such a likable
chap. And to find him murdered here in his home!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Corcoran shook a bewildered head. &ldquo;Have you any
clue to his murderer, Trenholm? Any later news
than that published in the morning paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not only the lawyer waited expectantly for the
sheriff&rsquo;s answer; Alan&rsquo;s eyes were glued to him,
and Roberts also was giving him undivided attention;
but Trenholm&rsquo;s expression told them nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The murder is still shrouded in mystery, Mr.
Corcoran,&rdquo; he replied quietly. &ldquo;We expected you
here for the funeral yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corcoran&rsquo;s face clouded over. &ldquo;I was in Richmond
and reached Washington late in the evening.
I telegraphed my clerk to take Paul&rsquo;s will out of my
office vault and bring it to the house this morning.
I have it here,&rdquo; tapping his brief case. He turned
to Alan. &ldquo;Did I understand correctly from the
papers that Mrs. Nash and her niece, Miss Elizabeth
Carter, are staying here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Alan, looking at him in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; then please ask them to be present
at the reading of the will. And, eh,&rdquo; looking about
him, &ldquo;do you prefer to have the reading take place
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan hesitated and glanced questioningly at Trenholm.
&ldquo;How about it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all right,&rdquo; agreed Trenholm. &ldquo;Will you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
ask Miss Carter to join us, Alan? I must speak to
one of my men,&rdquo; and the sheriff unceremoniously
opened one of the doors leading into the garden and
walked around the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget Mrs. Nash,&rdquo; called out Corcoran,
as Alan hurried into the dining room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is ill in bed,&rdquo; hastily broke in Roberts, as
Alan paused in uncertainty at the lawyer&rsquo;s hail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then ask her husband to be present, if he is
here,&rdquo; directed the lawyer. Corcoran moved over to
a wicker table and Roberts helped him remove some
magazines and books. Taking up his brief case, the
former unlocked it, drew out a pad of blank paper,
a pencil, and an official-looking document with an
imposing seal. Without unfolding it, he put the
document down in front of him and addressed Roberts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul was a queer character,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;In
many ways a lovable fellow, with a curious, suspicious
streak running through his make-up. In the
last few years he has trusted no one&mdash;entirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts&rsquo; expression grew serious. &ldquo;Cheerful and
morose by turns,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never knew how I
would find him, of late years&mdash;happy as a lark or
down in the depths. I attribute it,&rdquo; he lowered his
voice, &ldquo;to shell-shock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; agreed Corcoran. &ldquo;But you recall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
his mother. Ah, here is Miss Carter,&rdquo; as Betty
appeared, dressed in black, &ldquo;and Dr. Nash.&rdquo; The
lawyer shook hands with them gravely. &ldquo;Now, if
you will select chairs we will go ahead with the
reading of Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s will. Alan,&rdquo; as the latter
made a belated appearance, &ldquo;ask Mr. Trenholm to
come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty had selected a chair near the entrance to the
library and out of the direct sunlight. From where
she sat she caught a glimpse through the portières of
Trenholm standing talking to a man. He advanced
with Alan a moment later and entering the sunparlor,
closed not only the portières but the folding doors
as well.</p>

<p>Corcoran waited until every one was seated, then
took a chair himself, and, picking up the will, put
on his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, holding up the document so all
might see the seal, &ldquo;is the last will and testament of
Paul Mason Abbott, duly executed in my office on
July 23, 1922, six months ago, and witnessed by
responsible persons, whose names are attached hereto.&rdquo;
He cleared his throat. &ldquo;The will reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">In the Name of God, Amen.</span> I, Paul Mason
Abbott, being of sound mind, and residing at Abbott&rsquo;s
Lodge, Hills Bridge, Prince Georges County, Maryland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
do declare this to be my last will and testament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give and bequeath to Alan Mason, my cousin and
only near relation, $500 in liberty bonds and the burial
ground, known as the Mason Plot, adjacent to my
estate of Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my good friend and physician, Doctor William
Roberts of Washington, $5,000. To my neighbor, Guy
Trenholm of Upper Marlboro, the valuable hunting
prints which he so often admired, a sapphire and diamond
scarf-pin, and $25,000.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Mrs. Nash, for much kindness and hospitality
shown me, my silver service, bearing the crest of the
Abbotts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Martha and Charles Corbin, for their faithful
service to my father, I give the sum of $1,000 each,
and permission to live, rent free, in the gardener&rsquo;s
cottage at Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, for the rest of their natural
lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my fiancée, Miss Elizabeth Carter of Washington,
I bequeath Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, and the real and personal
estate, not otherwise specified, of which I die
possessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should Miss Carter marry after my death, my special
bequest to her stands revoked, and Alan Mason
will become my residuary legatee, provided he is married
before my death. If such is not the case, then
all my property, as above specified, is to revert to the
State of Maryland and Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge be made a convalescent
hospital for disabled American soldiers and
a fund provided for its upkeep, and administered by
officials appointed by the Governor of Maryland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hereby appoint Daniel Corcoran of Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
my executor, and I charge him to see that all my just
debts are paid out of my estate before it is divided.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;(Signed) <span class="smcap">Paul Mason Abbott.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Absolute silence followed the reading of the will.
Corcoran laid it down and took several papers out
of his brief case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have here a complete list of Paul Abbott&rsquo;s real
estate holdings, investments and securities,&rdquo; he
stated. &ldquo;Roughly, his estate is estimated at a little
over one million dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm broke the thunderstruck silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and involuntarily his
eyes traveled to Betty Carter and Alan Mason. The
latter was leaning against the door, looking dazedly
at the little lawyer. Betty had risen and Corcoran,
catching her glance, addressed her. He was a trifle
confused by her expression and hastened to adjust
his glasses that he might see her more distinctly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul Abbott loved you devotedly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as
you can judge from his will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love?&rdquo; Betty could hardly articulate; her eyes
were dark with passion. &ldquo;Love, did you say? That
is a will of <i>hate</i>,&rdquo; and before any one could stop
her she had flung open the folding doors and darted
into the dining room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="reduce">THREE BEEHIVES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">iriam</span> looked at her watch&mdash;two o&rsquo;clock.
The brilliant sunlight and the out of doors
exerted an appeal she could not resist.
Stopping only long enough to put on her hat
and coat, she started down the corridor and, when
passing Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s door, paused irresolutely. Mrs.
Nash had recovered, when she left her at eight
o&rsquo;clock that morning, from her fright at discovering
the disguised man in her room, but Miriam was
troubled about her heart condition. She felt that
she should speak to Somers before she went for her
walk. She had told the maid to call her at any time
if she needed assistance. If Mrs. Nash was asleep
she could slip out without disturbing her.</p>

<p>Miriam softly turned the knob of the door and
pushed it gently open, intending to beckon to Somers
to come into the hall. She had opened it but a few
inches when she heard Alexander Nash address his
wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just received a telegram from Canada,
Dora,&rdquo; he said, and added more quickly as his wife
looked up, a question on her lips, &ldquo;from Frank
Chisholm telling me of the sudden death of Boris
Zybinn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s reply was unheard by Miriam. She
leaned limply against the doorjamb, her strength
stricken from her. Their voices sounded far distant&mdash;unreal.
It was fully two minutes before her
brain cleared and she had a realizing sense of what
Nash was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A remarkable will,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Alan receives
practically nothing from his cousin, while
Guy Trenholm is given twenty-five thousand dollars,
a scarf-pin, and those wonderful old hunting prints.
It is really extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam waited to hear no more. Closing the door
as softly as she had opened it, she stole back to her
room, unlocked her bag, and drew from it the letter
she had found in Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom the night
before. For a time she stood quite still, balancing
the unopened letter in her hand; once she took up a
hairpin, then laid it down, unused. Boris Zybinn!
She shook her head and glanced about as if awakening
from a nightmare.</p>

<p>A sound of voices coming through her open window
caused her to look outside. Anna, her work done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
for the time being, was, as she expressed it to
Martha later, &ldquo;joshing&rdquo; one of the constable&rsquo;s assistants&mdash;a
young deputy whose susceptible heart
had made him a willing victim to her wiles. The
deputy&rsquo;s presence gave Miriam a sudden idea. Carefully
placing the unopened letter in her hand bag,
she went downstairs and hastened through the dining
room, intending to go out of the door of the sunparlor
and from there to the back of the house.</p>

<p>Martha&mdash;a rejuvenated Martha&mdash;looked up from
changing the tablecloth at her approach, and Miriam,
in spite of her absorption in her own affairs, noticed
her changed appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye heard, Miss&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she began incoherently.
&ldquo;Mr. Paul, God rest his soul, has left
me and Charles one thousand dollars each.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? I congratulate you, Martha.&rdquo; Miriam
shifted her hand bag and held it more firmly
against her. There was an intangible something
about Martha which invited distrust. &ldquo;Mr. Abbott
was most generous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes Miss&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am; he had call to be,&rdquo; Martha&rsquo;s
voice had assumed its old complaining whine. &ldquo;Us
took good care of him. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you
Miss&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am, that my husband ain&rsquo;t quite satisfied.
He wants more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Martha&rsquo;s grievances were displacing her
first feeling of elation at the, to her, large sum of
money. &ldquo;Charles, he&rsquo;s mad, clean through. He
says he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to Sheriff Trenholm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why to the Sheriff?&rdquo; questioned Miriam in
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s kinder good at giving advice&mdash;when ye
got something to tell him.&rdquo; Martha&rsquo;s slow, expressive
wink annoyed Miriam and without paying further
attention to the woman, she went through the
sunparlor and outside the house.</p>

<p>Martha, in no wise disturbed by Miriam&rsquo;s cool
reception of her confidences, went slowly on with
her work, her mental process of &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; betrayed
by her facial contortions.</p>

<p>The young deputy was just starting his engine
when Miriam appeared at the side of his car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where I will find Sheriff Trenholm?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>Ben Riley touched his hat and a pleased smile stole
over his freckled face. He had admired Miriam at
a distance for several days, although she had been
utterly oblivious of his existence. That she might
be under surveillance never entered her head. The
indefatigable Martha had complained to her of the
presence about Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge of a number of deputies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
and Riley had been pointed out to her by
Somers as one of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sheriff&rsquo;s at his home,&rdquo; Riley explained, then,
as her face showed plainly her disappointment, he
added, &ldquo;Can I take a message to him? I&rsquo;m on my
way there now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Miriam to think was to act. It was imperative
that she see Trenholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I drive over with you?&rdquo; she asked, and her
charming smile completed Riley&rsquo;s conquest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Ward,&rdquo; he stammered, with gratifying
emphasis, and opened the door of his roadster.
&ldquo;Hop in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had gone half the distance to Upper Marlboro
and were about to turn from the main road
to the one leading to Trenholm&rsquo;s bungalow, when
they were passed by Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s Rolls-Royce which
continued down the main road at such a speed that
Miriam had only a glimpse of Alexander Nash
seated by the chauffeur. The fur collar of Pierre&rsquo;s
heavy chauffeur&rsquo;s overcoat was turned up about his
face and his most intimate friend would have failed
to recognize him as he drove along, under Nash&rsquo;s
instructions, breaking the speed laws of Maryland.</p>

<p>Pablo, the Filipino, answered Miriam&rsquo;s ring of
the door bell at the bungalow with a promptness that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
suggested that he had observed Riley&rsquo;s car when
it turned into the driveway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come inside, Mees,&rdquo; he said with hospitable intent.
&ldquo;My master will return in one little moment.
He is in de garage and I will go at once and tell
him that you are here. It is cold, yes?&rdquo; as the
rising wind blew the daily papers off the hall table.
He closed the door with alacrity and led the way
into the library. &ldquo;Sit down, Mees, and be comfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam hardly noticed his departure. The long
drive over had brought reflection in its train and
she was regretting her hasty action. She glanced
about the library, taking in, as Alan had done the
night before, its suggestion of cultivation, its homelike
atmosphere. Guy Trenholm&rsquo;s personality permeated
the room. She did not sit down, as Pablo
had suggested, but remained by the table in deep
thought, and Trenholm, about to enter the room,
stopped in the doorway and studied her intently.
The proud poise of her head, her becoming toque, her
plain, but well-fitting coat, her vivid coloring, made
more brilliant by her drive in the wind, all were a
fitting complement to the setting in which she stood.
Trenholm caught his breath and his heart beat more
quickly, but his expression and voice conveyed no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
feeling beyond a courteous welcome as he stepped
forward to greet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; he asked, pulling forward
a chair. &ldquo;I am sorry to have kept you waiting.
Let me help you with your coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam thanked him, then sat down and waited
for him to take the chair opposite hers. As he looked
at her inquiringly, she came directly to the point.
Opening her hand bag, she took out the letter bearing
the Canadian postage and held it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found this letter,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when on duty
last night. It was tucked in one of the chairs in
Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom. I bring it to you as I found
it&mdash;unopened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm took the letter from her outstretched
hand, and turned it over several times before making
any comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is there about the letter to have attracted
your attention, Miss Ward?&rdquo; he finally asked,
and wondered at the look in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The seal,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;It matches this,&rdquo;
and she drew out of her bag the half-burnt envelope
and turned it over so that he could view
the flap with its black crest. &ldquo;It is that crest of
which you found drawings in my bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I recognize the three beehives,&rdquo; he replied.
Leaning back in his chair he reached over and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
up a heavy volume from a smoking stand where
he had flung it earlier that day. &ldquo;I borrowed this
book on heraldry from the Congressional Library,&rdquo;
he explained, and turned the leaves with lightning
rapidity until he found the page he wished. &ldquo;See,
the three beehives,&rdquo; pointing to a fine colored engraving,
&ldquo;and the proud motto of the Paltoffs of
Russia&mdash;&lsquo;Always without Fear.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam stared at the printed page and then at
Trenholm, and respect and admiration were in her
glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was clever of you,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;So
you guess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much,&rdquo; quietly, &ldquo;except your connection with
the Paltoffs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam looked about the library. There was no
likelihood of their conversation being interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dmitri Paltoff, Grand Maitre de la Cour, married
my aunt,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;He was the last
of his race, and when he was killed, the right to
use that crest died with him. Its use on these envelopes
was consequently a shock, and aroused my
keenest interest at once, for&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated and
spoke more slowly&mdash;&ldquo;this black crest has a peculiar
indentation and varies in no particular from the seal
on my uncle&rsquo;s watch fob, which I saw snatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
from his dying grasp by a Bolshevik in Vladivostok.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm was regarding her with absorbed interest.
&ldquo;So that was it,&rdquo; he murmured, then raised
his voice slightly. &ldquo;Do you, by chance, know the
Bolshevik who took the seal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was my uncle&rsquo;s secretary, Boris Zybinn.&rdquo;
Miriam leaned forward in her earnestness. &ldquo;Just
before I left Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, I accidentally overheard
Doctor Nash tell his wife that he had a telegram
from Canada stating that Boris had died
suddenly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm stared at her a moment. Rising with
some abruptness, he went over to the wall, touched
a concealed spring and one of the wooden panels
slid aside and revealed the door of a small safe.
When he came back and resumed his old seat, he
carried a package of letters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I watched you when you glanced over these
letters,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;in the hall at Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.
And I have read them a dozen times trying to find
out what there was about them which claimed such
interest on your part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was looking for the black crest,&rdquo; she admitted.
&ldquo;You see the envelopes are identical with this burnt
one,&rdquo; holding it up again. &ldquo;I did not open any of
the letters. Who wrote them?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They are signed by Boris Zybinn,&rdquo; Trenholm
opened several and laid them in her lap. &ldquo;Do you
recognize the handwriting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No. Boris was clever; he
might easily have learned to disguise his writing.
He was an excellent linguist, as most Russians are.
What was he doing in Canada?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentleman farming,&rdquo; answered Trenholm. &ldquo;He
had a place outside of Toronto and adjoining Doctor
Nash&rsquo;s country estate. It was while visiting
Nash that Paul Abbott and he became acquainted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these letters, what are they about?&rdquo; questioned
Miriam eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farming,&rdquo; briefly. &ldquo;And nothing else. Paul
wished to model his place here after Zybinn&rsquo;s, especially
his fruit orchard. I suppose that he kept them,
for reference,&rdquo; and Trenholm tossed the remaining
letters on his desk table which stood almost at
Miriam&rsquo;s elbow.</p>

<p>Miriam drew back in bitter disappointment. &ldquo;And
that is all,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I have indeed found a
mare&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as the letters go,&rdquo; agreed Trenholm, with
characteristic frankness. &ldquo;But there is another matter
of vital importance,&rdquo; he glanced carefully about
the room, sprang up and closed both of the doors,
one of which led into the main hall and the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
into a smaller room, where he generally conducted
business. When he came back to Miriam he moved
his chair closer to her side. &ldquo;You know of the
Paltoff diamond?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have heard its history often from my
uncle,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It was given by one of his
ancestors to Peter the Great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To purchase royal favor,&rdquo; supplemented Trenholm
&ldquo;And forms one of the Crown jewels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wrong,&rdquo; she corrected him swiftly. &ldquo;It
is not a Crown jewel, but it has always been in the
possession of the reigning Czar, handed down from
father to son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is it now, Miss Ward?&rdquo; The swift
question took her unawares and she grew pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she stated, and her eyes did
not falter before his searching glance. &ldquo;Frankly, I
do not know its present whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a rumor that it was smuggled out of
Russia.&rdquo; Trenholm never took his eyes from her.
&ldquo;Can you tell me if that is true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not at once reply and he did not hurry
her. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; she demanded finally.
&ldquo;What is your interest in the Paltoff diamond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo; Trenholm opened his leather wallet and
took from it a folded note. &ldquo;Read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Slowly Miriam took in the sense of the written
sentence:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let him who hopes to solve the mystery of Paul
Abbott&rsquo;s death find the lost Paltoff jewel.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; She half rose from her chair, then
dropped back again. Her face was ghastly and
Trenholm watched her in growing concern. &ldquo;Who
wrote this note?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know. I found it in the pocket of my
overcoat when I returned from Paul&rsquo;s funeral.&rdquo;
Trenholm paused. &ldquo;The handwriting is unfamiliar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He doubted if Miriam heard his last sentence;
she kept so quiet, so immovable. Suddenly she
pressed her fingers to her eyes and when she took
them away, the lids were wet. She looked at him
long and searchingly. Could she trust him? She
<i>must</i>&mdash;there was no other course open to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you in confidence what I know of the
Paltoff diamond,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you must pledge
me your word not to repeat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you my word,&rdquo; Trenholm held out his
hand, and as she felt his strong, steady clasp her
heart lightened and her sense of utter loneliness
grew less.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be as brief as possible.&rdquo; She paused to
clear her throat of a suspicious lump. &ldquo;My father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
John Ward of Indianapolis, was in the Diplomatic
service, and stationed for a long time in Russia,
where we lived with my aunt and her husband.
After father&rsquo;s death, mother and I came to New
York. She was a great invalid and did not long
survive him.&rdquo; She stumbled in her speech and
stopped, and Trenholm gave her a moment to collect
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he prompted gently. &ldquo;Continue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother died just before the outbreak of the
World War,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;It was necessary for
me to find employment and I decided to become a
nurse. I trained at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and went
overseas at once upon graduation. It would be too
long to tell you of my experiences, but finally I
reached Russia and saw service in the hospitals
there. Then came the revolution.&rdquo; She drew in
her breath sharply. &ldquo;God! The horrors that we
lived through&mdash;the Bolsheviki were fiends in human
form!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Paltoff diamond?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the diamond.&rdquo; She collected herself. &ldquo;My
uncle was for years Grand Master of the Imperial
Court and trusted absolutely by the Czar. Just before
he was made prisoner, the Czar took from the
hilt of his dress sword, worn only on state occasions,
the Paltoff diamond, and charged Uncle Dmitri, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
his fealty to the Crown, to smuggle it out of Russia,
and raise money upon it so that, should the Imperial
family have to flee, something might be saved
for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo; demanded Trenholm as
she paused.</p>

<p>Miriam sighed. &ldquo;My uncle saw his gallant son
crucified before his eyes; his daughters, taken prisoners
with other ladies of the Court, were transported
by steamer to a loathsome prison. Before
the vessel docked they threw themselves into the sea,
oh, gladly&rdquo;&mdash;she added, seeing Trenholm&rsquo;s expression&mdash;&ldquo;for
the captain and his crew forced them
to leave their cabin doors unlocked at night.&rdquo; She
paused and put her hands before her eyes. When
she looked up, Trenholm saw tragedy mirrored in
their dark depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With other refugees Uncle Dmitri and I finally
reached Vladivostok, in rags and our money gone.
Oh, Mr. Trenholm, pray God that you may never
know what starvation is!&rdquo; She stopped to control
her voice. &ldquo;We lived in a hovel in the filthiest
part of the city. I had lost my passport or it had
been stolen from me. I applied to the American
consul&mdash;he promised help but none came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; Trenholm took her hand and pressed
it warmly. &ldquo;Would you rather stop?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Uncle Dmitri still had the Paltoff diamond
and despite our agony would not part with it. When
we dared to talk, for spies were all around us, we
tried to plan to get the jewel safely out of Russia,
even if we ourselves failed to reach the United
States.&rdquo; Miriam stopped to clear her throat, for
her voice had grown husky with emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One morning I was half delirious from hunger
and privation, when Uncle Dmitri came inside the
hovel followed by a man,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;He
crawled over to the straw on which I lay and told
me that his companion was an American soldier
who had saved his life in a brawl with drunken
peasants. He feared that he had been recognized
as Paltoff, the trusted friend of the Czar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; broke in Trenholm. &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our plight was desperate and my uncle took the
American into his confidence, and the latter agreed
to carry the diamond to the United States, provided
he could smuggle it aboard the transport.&rdquo; She
sighed deeply. &ldquo;I was too ill to follow all that was
said, but uncle took the diamond from its hiding
place and the American sat down near me and
unwound a bandage from about a wound in the calf
of his leg. At his direction I opened the wound,
placed the diamond inside it, and, having a surgeon&rsquo;s
field service kit which a doctor, like ourselves a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
refugee, had left in the hovel the day before, I
sutured the wound and replaced the bandages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm stared at her. &ldquo;American brains and
pluck!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and the admiration in his
voice brought the swift color to her white cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The American had not been gone five minutes
before Boris Zybinn came in, followed by a swarm
of the Bolsheviki,&rdquo; she went on, keeping her voice
steady by an effort of will only, as the tragic scene
rose vividly before her. &ldquo;A whisper had gotten
around that Uncle Dmitri had the Paltoff diamond.
They put him to torture and he died as a brave
man should, without fear and without betraying
the Czar&rsquo;s trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you? What did they do to you?&rdquo; demanded
Trenholm, his usually calm tones betraying interest
at fever heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The American consul came in time to save me
from all but this.&rdquo; Drawing back her sleeve she
showed a brand burned into the soft white flesh.
&ldquo;Thank God! I had the strength to tell Boris nothing
of the diamond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm leaned forward impulsively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to shake hands with you,&rdquo; he said, and the strong
clasp of his fingers made her wince. There was a
brief pause before he asked: &ldquo;And the name of
the American soldier?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>Miriam drew from around her neck a gold chain
from which hung a locket. Opening it she took out
a tiny soiled paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The soldier wrote down his name and address
and handed it to Uncle Dmitri,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;But Boris got there before he could give it to me
and it was torn up&mdash;all but this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm looked long and carefully at the one
letter on the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;M&rsquo;,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;&lsquo;M&rsquo;&mdash;it is Paul Abbott&rsquo;s
peculiar formation of his middle initial. I have
seen it too often to be mistaken. And Paul Abbott,
I know, saw service with the A.E.F. in Vladivostok.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="reduce">THE THIRTEENTH LETTER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="smcap">uy Trenholm</span> raised his head. &ldquo;May
I keep this little paper in my safe?&rdquo; he
asked, taking it up. &ldquo;I will return it at
any time should you require it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam snapped her locket shut and slipped it
inside her gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The paper is far safer with you than with
me,&rdquo; she replied, and sat quietly in her chair until
Trenholm returned from placing it in a compartment
of his safe. &ldquo;It is incredible that Paul Abbott
should have been the American soldier to whom
Uncle Dmitri intrusted the diamond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not impossible,&rdquo; retorted Trenholm. &ldquo;And
the law of chance brought you to his bedside just
before his death. How was it you failed to recognize
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never really saw the American soldier&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;
She sat back in a more comfortable position, conscious,
for the first time, of complete fatigue.
Recounting the tragic death of her Russian relatives
and her own suffering, even to Trenholm&rsquo;s sympathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
ears, was a severe strain. &ldquo;We had no window
in our hovel; only the faint light from a candle.
I believe he wore a beard, but I was too ill to care,
at the moment, what he looked like. My uncle
trusted him and that was enough. Five years have
passed since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; exclaimed Trenholm sympathetically,
then with a tenaciousness which was part of
the man, he added: &ldquo;Was there nothing familiar
about Paul&rsquo;s appearance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No. I have no doubt that
illness had changed his appearance, Mr. Trenholm,
to some extent. But with the Paltoff diamond far
from my thoughts, and looking upon Mr. Abbott
simply as a patient, if he had seemed even vaguely
familiar I would have attributed it to the same feeling
one has in passing a stranger in the street whom
one might have met somewhere. You know the
sensation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Have you
made no effort to trace the Paltoff diamond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was desperately ill for months, Mr. Trenholm;
and it was fully a year before I regained anything
like my old strength. There was no one I could
rely upon&mdash;no one in whom I had confidence. I
tried, however, to interest one man, a lawyer,&rdquo; her
lips tightened, &ldquo;that experience taught me a lesson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
I shall never forget.&rdquo; She turned scarlet and for
the first time dropped her eyes before Trenholm&rsquo;s
glance. She missed the sudden hot wrath which
kindled in his eyes; a second later and he had himself
in hand again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you describe the diamond, Miss Ward?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;And tell me its value?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a diamond of astonishing purity, of about
forty-nine carats, and has an extraordinary play
and brilliance,&rdquo; answered Miriam. &ldquo;Though much
smaller in size than other world-famous diamonds,
it is claimed by experts to be an absolutely flawless
gem. I believe it is worth in the neighborhood
of $200,000 and possibly more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low whistle escaped Trenholm. &ldquo;A frightful
invitation to crime!&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Boris Zybinn was in Canada and in communication
with Paul Abbott,&rdquo; pointed out Miriam
slowly. &ldquo;Mr. Trenholm, I know a little of the evil
accomplished by that renegade Russian. There is
some significance in those letters of his to Mr.
Abbott, innocent as they may appear. I will <i>never</i>
believe otherwise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm leaned forward and, picking up the
letters, laid them in Miriam&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Read them
over carefully,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I am open to conviction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
But look here, Miss Ward, why didn&rsquo;t Zybinn
come down to Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge and visit Paul and
then steal the diamond? He might have done that
without arousing suspicion. Why write letters
about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly he feared arrest and extradition for a
former crime if he came into the United States,&rdquo;
suggested Miriam, and Trenholm straightened up
abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be something in that idea,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;Read the letters aloud, Miss Ward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obediently Miriam opened first one and then
another. Except for the precision of the language
used, none were out of the ordinary. Each letter
began: &ldquo;My dear Abbott,&rdquo; and closed with the conventional,
&ldquo;Yours sincerely,&rdquo; and the signature,
&ldquo;Boris Zybinn.&rdquo; The contents of each referred
only to agriculture. Miriam dropped the last one
in her lap with a despondent gesture; then her
expression brightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t looked at the unopened letter,&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;See, you have left it there on the
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm picked up the envelope and examined
it carefully. &ldquo;It is just like the others in appearance,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;It must have come several days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
before Paul&rsquo;s murder,&rdquo; examining the postmark.
&ldquo;Corbin, however, can answer that question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why Mr. Abbott did not read it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too ill, perhaps&mdash;especially if he judged the
letter unimportant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm hunted about on his table until he found
a letter opener and, using it dextrously, succeeded in
raising the flap without breaking the seal. Taking
care not to crease or otherwise mar the envelope, he
drew out the folded sheet and read aloud the brief
message it contained:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap right1">Sunnymeade Farm</span><br />
<span class="smcap right2">Toronto, Canada</span><br />
<span class="right3">January 22, 1923</span></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Abbott</span>:</p>

<p>Sorry to learn that you are not well. Perhaps a
change may do you good. Why not run up here for a
week or two? I will be very happy to put you up if the
Nashs are not at their place.</p>

<p>Chisholm says the two grays are seventeen hands and
entirely sound. Would advise offer of a thousand for
the pair.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="right2">Yours in haste,</span><br />
<span class="smcap right3">Boris Zybinn.</span></p>

<p>Trenholm tossed down the letter in disgust.
&ldquo;Nothing to that!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;They have fine
horses in Canada, and Paul purchased several last
year, and sold them at a good figure to one of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
neighbors. What is it, Miss Ward?&rdquo; observing her
changed expression.</p>

<p>Without answering, Miriam pulled her chair
around so that she sat facing the table. Picking up
the letters she spread each one, with its envelope,
before her, and slowly counted them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eleven,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and this burnt envelope
is twelve, and this last letter makes a total of thirteen
<i>unimportant</i> letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; asked Trenholm, struck by her
manner. Going around the table he stood looking
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you noticed the postage?&rdquo; she queried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely. They are Canadian stamps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t postage from Canada three cents for first-class
mail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why does each letter bear <i>five one-cent</i>
stamps?&rdquo; glancing swiftly upward. &ldquo;Boris Zybinn
must have known the correct postage required.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he thought that his letters weighed more
than one ounce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If so, the postage would have been double, or
<i>six</i> cents,&rdquo; she remarked quickly. &ldquo;Five cents would
not have covered it. Besides, I don&rsquo;t believe that one
of these letters weighs over an ounce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm reached over and picked up his letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
scales. &ldquo;Try one,&rdquo; he suggested, and, as she did so,
&ldquo;Not quite one ounce. Try the next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam laid each letter on the scales, first putting
it back in its proper envelope; not one was above
one ounce in weight!</p>

<p>&ldquo;They all come under the three-cent postage rate,&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Any one writing as many as thirteen
letters to one correspondent would have found
out that fact, especially a person living in Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm considered Miriam and then the letters
in silence for a minute. Picking up the thirteenth
letter, which Miriam had brought to him unopened
that afternoon, he took out the sheet of paper and
held the envelope up to the light and studied it intently.
As he lowered it, Miriam caught sight of his
face and sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have found something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, thanks to your persistency!&rdquo; And she
colored warmly at the enthusiasm in his voice and
manner. &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; and Trenholm again held the
envelope up to the light and at an angle so that she
could see it as well as he. &ldquo;The edges of the stamps
appear cut in a wedge shape in certain places, and
there are several pinholes through two of the stamps.
The cuts do not appear to result from the careless
tearing off of the stamps from the sheet, and consequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
damage to the perforations, but are apparently
made with scissors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; agreed Miriam. &ldquo;And when
the letter has no light behind it, they do not show at
all against the white ground of the envelope. Is it
a code?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm twirled his mustache in perplexity.
&ldquo;The cuts appear at irregular intervals,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;They seem to be hastily made and are not absolutely
uniform. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off abruptly,
stood in thought for several seconds, then going
over to the book shelves which lined one of the walls,
searched about until he located several books and
carried them back to the table where Miriam stood
examining the thirteenth envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strangely enough,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s father
gave me his stamp collection&mdash;a fine one&mdash;as Paul
never had the craze for collecting stamps even as a
boy, and being a human magpie I keep everything
bestowed upon me,&rdquo; with a quick boyish smile which
softened wonderfully his usually self-repressed expression.
&ldquo;I hope luck is with me and I still have
tucked inside one of these albums a perforation
gauge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perforations, Miss Ward, have a definite position
on each stamp with relation to one another,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
though they may be irregular on two separate
stamps,&rdquo; went on Trenholm. &ldquo;In other words, the
distance between perforations is always the same,
though they may vary a fractional part of a line in
their position at the corners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the gauge,&rdquo; she prompted, as he paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is used to measure the number of perforations to
the inch,&rdquo; Trenholm spoke slowly, to be sure that she
understood his meaning. &ldquo;By applying a perforation
gauge to the edge of a stamp, if the position of
one perforation is known, that of all the others will
be indicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm paused and opened one of the stamp
albums. He turned the pages rapidly, and found
the stamp he wanted, but no gauge. Taking up the
other album he shook it over the table. A small
shower of loose stamps, several odd envelopes and
a piece of bristol board fell on the table. With a
relieved exclamation, Trenholm clutched the perforation
gauge, brushing the stamps aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a Canadian stamp of the same issue,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Paul wrote me when he was last in Canada,
and I kept the stamp. Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam waited with absorbed attention while he
applied the gauge to the stamp. When he looked up
his eyes were shining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The stamp has exactly fifty-two perforations,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;Can it be a coincidence or a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her without speaking for a moment.
&ldquo;The number is just twice that of the letters of the
alphabet.&rdquo; Trenholm drew in his breath. &ldquo;I have
come to your way of thinking, Miss Ward. It must
be a code, and it may be that two alphabets are registered
on each stamp, the cuts corresponding to the
letters according to the number of the particular
perforation affected, counting from one corner of
the stamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam, who had been following his explanation
with close attention, nodded her head wisely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;That would explain any
irregularity in the cuts, because for coding it would
be sufficient to indicate the perforation intended to be
cut, without making a mark of a definite character,
and with this gauge of yours the number of the perforation
which has been cut would be recognized at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Without a gauge there
would be great difficulty in determining the number
of the perforation, because the cut might seem to
create new indentations if carelessly made.&rdquo; Trenholm
stopped and took up the envelope of the thirteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
letter and applied his gauge to the left-hand
stamp, and Miriam, pencil in hand, assisted him.</p>

<p>Trenholm counted clockwise. &ldquo;Five perforations
are damaged,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;numbers 8, 20, 23, 27,
30. Now, if the code is based on a double alphabet,
these would become 8, 20, 23, 1, 3, or the letters
H, T, W, A, C. How are the letters to be arranged,
Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at her pad, where she had jotted down
the letters as well as the figures. &ldquo;There is only one
vowel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It must be one word. Then why
use two alphabets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly because of the accidental chance that the
stamp perforations count up to fifty-two,&rdquo; replied
Trenholm. &ldquo;It would be convenient, in case of a
word with many letters, to prevent destroying the
appearance of the stamp by cutting too many indentations
close to one another. Have you solved the
first word?&rdquo; as she checked an exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&lsquo;watch.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Trenholm&rsquo;s eyes were bright with excitement.
Looking again at the first stamp, he
noticed that the first, third, and fifth letters of the
words &ldquo;watch&rdquo; were indicated on the first alphabet,
and the remaining letters on the second one.</p>

<p>Trenholm held up the envelope to the light again.
&ldquo;See, Miss Ward!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The stamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
on the extreme right has only four indentations,
though the left-hand corner has been cut off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She studied the envelope in silence for a few
seconds. &ldquo;The letters are G and E in the first alphabet,&rdquo;
she pointed out. &ldquo;They must be the odd letters
of the word coded, and R and V in the second alphabet,
corresponding to the even letters, but I can&rsquo;t
make any word out of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we call the cut of the left-hand corner
of the stamp an A,&rdquo; suggested Trenholm. &ldquo;It may
be a quick way to mark an indentation when a corner
square was involved; though better care was used
in the A of the second alphabet in the first stamp
examined. What word have you now, Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm stared at her. &ldquo;Grave,&rdquo; he repeated,
then, suppressing comment, went ahead decoding the
message. &ldquo;This center one appears the simplest,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Here the perforations cut are numbers
5, 12, 20, 5, 18, 20&mdash;odd letters, E, L, T; even letters,
E, R, T. Got them down, Miss Ward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They make the word&mdash;letter,&rdquo; briefly, not glancing
up. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next letters are E, I, T, for the odd, and
E, H, N, R, for the even.&rdquo; Trenholm laid down his
perforation gauge and frowned. &ldquo;The code seems
to fail here,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;It has given four even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
letters and only three odd. The other way around
would be all right, but it is impossible to make a
word with more even than odd letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see the envelope.&rdquo; Miriam put aside her
pencil and carefully examined the stamps against
the light. &ldquo;Look, Mr. Trenholm, here are pinholes
opposite some of the letters&mdash;two opposite the odd
T, and one opposite the even H.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably they stand for repetitions of the same
letters, in which case the letters would be: odd&mdash;E,
I, T, T, T; even&mdash;E, H, H, N, R,&rdquo; declared Trenholm.
&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo; He paused
and looked at the stamps already decoded. &ldquo;See
here, the first letter in each word we have deciphered
is on the side of the stamp which faces the left side
of the envelope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then that accounts for the apparently careless
manner in which the stamps are stuck on the
envelope,&rdquo; said Miriam. &ldquo;The only letter on
the second stamp, which is indicated by a cut in the
way you have just described, is T.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So our next word begins with T.&rdquo; Trenholm
took up a pencil and did some figuring on Miriam&rsquo;s
pad. &ldquo;With so many T&rsquo;s and H&rsquo;s to use, suppose
we start off with Th,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and the next letter
is either E, I, or T. It must be one of the vowels.
No, E is no good.&rdquo; Trenholm ran his fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
through his hair until it stood upright. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take
I, and here is an R available&mdash;by Jove&mdash;<i>thirteenth</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; Miriam&rsquo;s excitement was rising.
&ldquo;The words we have so far are, &lsquo;watch thirteenth
letter&mdash;&mdash;grave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the last stamp!&rdquo; Trenholm took up
gauge and pencil. &ldquo;The odd letters are E, two I&rsquo;s,
one indicated by another pinhole, and S. The even
letters are C, D, S, U. The position of the stamp
shows that the first letter is S. Of the four even
letters available for the next position, only the vowel
can be used, making Su.&rdquo; Trenholm paused and
wrote rapidly several combinations of the available
letters, then looked up with a low exclamation&mdash;&ldquo;Suicides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the completed message then stands&mdash;&lsquo;Watch
thirteenth letter suicides grave,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated Miriam.
&ldquo;What do you make of it, Mr. Trenholm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;now,&rdquo; he admitted frankly. &ldquo;We
know the code. Help me decipher these other eleven
envelopes and the burnt one. Fortunately the stamps
on it are intact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour later Miriam and Trenholm sat back
in their chairs and looked at each other. The latter
took up one of the pads they had used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are the thirteen decoded messages, of five
words each, concealed in the stamps on the thirteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
envelopes,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;Listen carefully, Miss Ward,
and tell me what you make of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam wrinkled her forehead in deep thought.
&ldquo;For whom were those messages intended, Mr.
Trenholm?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the man who later killed Paul Abbott,&rdquo; he
replied quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is some one who was with Paul and had access to
his mail, and so could read the code on these apparently
innocent letters.&rdquo; Trenholm rose suddenly and
looked down at her. &ldquo;It was a devilish scheme and
devilishly carried out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Boris Zybinn&rsquo;s confederate.&rdquo; Miriam also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
rose. &ldquo;Have you any idea who that confederate is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Absently Trenholm took up his pipe and fingered
it. &ldquo;Some one who knew Paul intimately,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And who has been with him during the past few
months, for the dates on these letters cover that
period of time. But as to his identity&mdash;the coded
messages give no clue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; agreed Miriam. &ldquo;Another question&mdash;When
he murdered Paul Abbott did he secure
the Paltoff diamond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm had located his tobacco pouch and filled
his pipe mechanically, his thoughts elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frankly,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I am inclined to think
he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="smcap">uy Trenholm</span> helped Miriam into his
powerful roadster and then, with a murmured
word of apology, slipped back into
his bungalow. Miriam waited patiently, unmindful
of his prolonged absence and thankful for the opportunity
of rest undisturbed. Her ideas were confused&mdash;chaotic.
The thirteen messages which she
and Trenholm had just decoded were ringing in her
head, but, try as she would, she could think of no
solution to the enigma. The Law of Chance had
indeed plunged her into an impenetrable mystery.
Trenholm&rsquo;s voice at her elbow caused her to start
slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am extremely sorry to have been so long,&rdquo; he
said, taking his place behind the steering wheel.
&ldquo;Pablo,&rdquo; to the Filipino, who had followed him from
the front door and was clinging frantically to the
collars of the police dogs in his endeavor to keep
them out of the car, &ldquo;let no one enter the house. If
any one calls on the telephone, tell them I am at
Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>The next instant the roadster had glided into the
highway, and with Trenholm&rsquo;s impatient foot on
the accelerator, was making record time in its dash
for Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.</p>

<p>Pablo was busy going about his work, whistling
shrilly, when a heavy knock on the side door interrupted
him. Answering it, he found a man in chauffeur&rsquo;s
livery just about to implant a heavy kick on
the panels by way of emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mastair, where is he?&rdquo; demanded Pierre,
and Pablo&rsquo;s back stiffened at his insolent manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your business,&rdquo; he retorted, and
slammed the door. The heavy bombardment of
knocks which followed was stopped by Alexander
Nash&rsquo;s appearance on the scene. He had waited in
the Nash limousine, but the sound of conflict stirred
him to action. His voice, raised in anger, caused
Pablo to glance through the pantry window, and at
sight of the clergyman, he at once opened the side
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is eet?&rdquo; he asked blandly, ignoring Pierre
utterly. &ldquo;Did some one knock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to see Sheriff Trenholm at once,&rdquo; stated
the clergyman. &ldquo;Tell him that Doctor Nash is
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is away.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Nash looked a trifle nonplussed, then
asked briskly, &ldquo;Where will I find him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pablo paused, in his turn, for reflection. Trenholm
had stated very clearly that should any one call
him by telephone he, Pablo, was to say that he was to
be found at Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge. Trenholm, however,
had specified a telephone call only, and not a caller
in person, therefore, according to Pablo&rsquo;s reasoning,
he could not divulge the whereabouts of his master
to Nash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gone out,&rdquo; he replied, assuming a stupid air
and lack of English, which he spoke remarkably
well, except for a distinct accent. &ldquo;No tell where
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash&rsquo;s disappointment was obvious. &ldquo;Think
again!&rdquo; he begged, and jingled some loose coins in
his pocket suggestively. But Pablo&rsquo;s total lack of
expression proved more exasperating than enlightening.
&ldquo;Come, where is the sheriff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; Pablo shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe he come
back to dinner, maybe not. Want to wait in your
car?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not.&rdquo; Nash frowned thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Let me use your telephone a moment,&rdquo; and he held
out a bank note.</p>

<p>Pablo backed away. &ldquo;Sorry, can&rsquo;t use&mdash;&rdquo; He
got no further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>Pierre, with a dexterity which Pablo had not
anticipated, had slipped between the Filipino and the
open door, and, with a vigorous push, sent Pablo
sprawling. But the latter was too quick for him.
With a spring like a panther, Pablo was on his back
and Pierre measured his length on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop this unseemly brawling,&rdquo; commanded Nash,
looking genuinely shocked. &ldquo;Pierre, go at once to
my car. As for you,&rdquo; turning to Pablo, who rose
with reluctance and one final kick which sent the
chauffeur&rsquo;s headgear down the path, &ldquo;I shall report
your conduct to Mr. Trenholm.&rdquo; And he stalked
away.</p>

<p>Without giving a thought to Pablo&rsquo;s habit of
taking everything he said literally, Trenholm slackened
the roadster&rsquo;s speed when they got within a
mile of Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see very much of Miss Carter?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. She is never with Mrs. Nash at night and
I am not around the house in the daytime,&rdquo; replied
Miriam. She hesitated perceptibly. &ldquo;Betty is the
only name given in the messages we decoded. Does
it refer to Miss Carter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom else could it refer?&rdquo; and Miriam was
silenced by his tone. She stole a look at Trenholm.
She dared not admit, even to herself, how frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
her thoughts were centered on the self-contained man
by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Ward&rdquo;&mdash;Trenholm drove the car to the
side of the road and stopped&mdash;&ldquo;did you catch sight
of the man in Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom early this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her answer was disappointing. &ldquo;No. I was halfway
up the staircase when I heard her cry out, but
when I reached her she was alone in the room,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;I had left the hall door partly open and
found it practically in the same position upon my
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm considered her answer for a second.
When he addressed her again she was struck by the
gravity of his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly what is the matter with Mrs. Nash?&rdquo; he
inquired. &ldquo;I am not asking from idle curiosity,
Miss Ward,&rdquo; observing her hesitation, &ldquo;but as an
officer of the law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam eyed him in startled wonder. What did
his question portend?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Roberts told me he felt that he had not
located the real trouble,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Nor can I
give a reason for her, at times, alarming symptoms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not venture an opinion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trenholm!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>He turned and his rare smile gave her a ray of
comfort and a sense of security.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unethical, I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you must
realize, Miss Ward, that we are confronted with a
dastardly conspiracy, the tentacles of which reach
from Russia to Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge. Can I not count
upon your aid to expose Zybinn&rsquo;s plot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can.&rdquo; Her voice rang out clearly, and again
Trenholm smiled, well pleased. &ldquo;I have sometimes
thought that Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s condition is due to a heart
depressant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A coal-tar poison,&rdquo; quietly. &ldquo;And by whom
administered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam moved unhappily. &ldquo;I am not in the sickroom
at all hours,&rdquo; she observed dryly. &ldquo;Miss Carter
is there during the day, and Doctor Nash spends
much time with his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm contemplated her, a gleam of something
besides admiration in his eyes; then shifting his
gears and releasing his brake, he drove onward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you recall the exact wording of the coded
message in the thirteenth letter?&rdquo; he asked, after a
brief silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was: &lsquo;Watch thirteenth letter suicides
grave,&rsquo;&rdquo; she looked at him inquiringly. &ldquo;Does the
word &lsquo;suicide&rsquo; take the possessive &lsquo;s&rsquo;, or is its meaning
plural?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen.&rdquo; He turned the car
into the driveway to Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, and before
stopping under the <i>porte cochère</i>, addressed her in a
voice carefully lowered to reach her ear alone. &ldquo;Say
nothing of the thirteen letters to <i>any one</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Of course not!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was quick to detect her hurt tone. &ldquo;Forgive
me,&rdquo; he begged, and his low, earnest voice impressed
her. &ldquo;I depend on your aid absolutely and trust you
implicitly,&rdquo; then as she flashed a glance upward of
glad relief, he added, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget those five words,
for I firmly believe that the solution to Paul&rsquo;s mysterious
murder rests in the thirteenth letter.&rdquo; Their
approach had been seen from inside the Lodge and
Corbin swung open the door. Trenholm had opportunity
for only one hurried sentence, &ldquo;The thirteenth
letter,&rdquo; he repeated, under his breath, &ldquo;of the alphabet
is &lsquo;M.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin favored Miriam with an unpleasant glance
as she sped by him into the house, but touched his
forehead, with some show of respect, to Trenholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Nash wishes to see ye,&rdquo; he stated. His
shifty eyes fell before the sheriff&rsquo;s steady gaze.
&ldquo;Can I have a word with ye, sir; me and Martha&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; inquiringly, as the caretaker paused in
uncertainty. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin licked his lips. Talking to the sheriff was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
not quite so easy a task as he had represented to
Martha, and he instantly shifted the responsibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s dressin&rsquo; now, sir; but she&rsquo;ll be down
d&rsquo;reckly,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;An&rsquo; before ye go, sir,
please ask for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm took silent note of the man&rsquo;s twitching
facial muscles and his unhealthy pallor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will send for Martha.
Wait&mdash;no, go on,&rdquo; as Corbin stopped reluctantly at
the first injunction, and, giving Trenholm no time
to reconsider his second order, he disappeared in the
direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Trenholm hung up his hat and overcoat in the
closet off the living room in deep thought. He had
intended questioning Corbin as to the hours of receiving
mail at Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, but he shrewdly
suspected that Martha would prove a more reliable
source of information, and so dismissed the caretaker
with the question unasked.</p>

<p>Trenholm&rsquo;s low tap on Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom door
brought Somers in response. On recognizing the
sheriff she drew back and held the door more widely
open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mistress is expecting you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come
in, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first time Mrs. Nash had met Guy
Trenholm face to face, though each had had glimpses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
of the other during Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s occasional visits to
Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge in the past. Under pretense of much
languor, she was slow in offering him her hand and
equally slow in releasing his. Trenholm&rsquo;s pressure
on her icy fingers forced her rings into her flesh, but
aside from a slight, very slight, intake of her breath,
she gave no sign of how much he hurt her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please take that chair,&rdquo; she said, as Somers,
obedient to previous instructions, pushed forward
the chair Miriam had occupied the night before and
in which she had found the thirteenth letter. &ldquo;You
will fill it nicely, Mr. Trenholm; it is made for such
big frames as you and my husband. I feel,&rdquo; she
added as he kept a discreet silence, waiting for her
to open the interview, &ldquo;that you and I should be old
acquaintances; I have heard so many nice things
about you from both Paul and his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Nash!&rdquo; Trenholm sat back
and eyed her gravely. Her rouge was cleverly
applied and her hair was becomingly dressed. But
to his critical mind there was something unnatural in
the high notes of her voice, in the constant tremble
of her hand, which, strive as she did, she could not
control. &ldquo;I have frequently hoped to meet you, and
frankly&rdquo;&mdash;with a disarming smile&mdash;&ldquo;particularly
after your experiences last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come directly to the point,&rdquo; she remarked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
&ldquo;I can only tell you that, after Miss Ward left me,
I closed my eyes&mdash;for a few minutes only&mdash;and
opened them to find the room in darkness, to feel
some one creeping to my bedside, the touch of the
beard on my hand&mdash;&rdquo; The shrug of her shoulders
was eloquent. &ldquo;Have you, Sheriff Trenholm, discovered
the identity of the intruder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I must admit failure,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Give me a little more time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She frowned, then smiled, and Trenholm decided
that a fiery temper was kept under iron control.
&ldquo;My husband has gone to employ a celebrated detective
agency to solve the mystery,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;I
thought that you should know and so sent for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; simply, and settling himself more
comfortably in the big chair Trenholm awaited her
next remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not exactly loquacious,&rdquo; she commented
dryly. &ldquo;Have you been told the terms of Paul
Abbott&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Your niece will inherit a very handsome
fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Provided she remains single the rest of her
natural life.&rdquo; Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s laugh smote unpleasantly
on his ear. &ldquo;Betty is so very young&mdash;not yet out of
her twenties. Does wealth compensate, Mr. Trenholm,
for a lonely old age?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To some natures it does.&rdquo; Trenholm&rsquo;s voice was
softly modulated to suit a sick room, and Mrs. Nash
had to listen attentively to catch every word he said.
&ldquo;It seems a pity that Paul and Miss Carter were
not married before his death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s eyelids flickered slightly; otherwise
she regarded him with unchanged expression. &ldquo;It is
a pity,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;in a way. But I have no doubt
that certain terms in Paul&rsquo;s ridiculous will can be set
aside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, on what grounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That he was not of sound mind when it was
drawn up,&rdquo; quietly. &ldquo;In view of the mystery surrounding
Paul&rsquo;s shocking murder, Mr. Trenholm,
I feel that you should be informed on certain
matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are they, Mrs. Nash?&rdquo; as she paused.
Trenholm was giving her flattering attention and she
smiled shrewdly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father had given his consent to Betty&rsquo;s
engagement to Paul,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;when, shortly
after, we noticed a change in Paul. His morbid
tendencies became more pronounced and he suffered
from the delusion that people were pursuing him.&rdquo;
She looked at Trenholm. &ldquo;You know the unfortunate
story of his mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That she died insane, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My father grew more and more distressed, for
Betty is his only grandchild. At last my husband
went to Doctor Roberts and asked him to join my
father&rsquo;s party on our yachting trip to Bermuda, so
that he might have Paul under mental observation.&rdquo;
Mrs. Nash paused to clear her throat. &ldquo;That was
only two months ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what conclusion did Roberts come to regarding
Paul&rsquo;s mental condition?&rdquo; questioned Trenholm
swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roberts is an old fogy!&rdquo; For once Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
self-control slipped. She had herself in hand again
before Trenholm could guess the cause of her emotion.
&ldquo;And his affection for Paul biased his judgment.
My husband would have done better had he
employed another physician.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm scrutinized her intently for several
minutes. &ldquo;And what connection is there between
Paul&rsquo;s mental condition and his murder?&rdquo; he asked
finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suicide&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm laughed outright. &ldquo;An utterly unpractical
theory, Mrs. Nash,&rdquo; he remarked, and the dryness
of his tone brought the carmine to her cheeks
under her rouge. &ldquo;It was physically impossible for
Paul to have stabbed himself.&rdquo; He rose without ceremony
and stared openly about the big bedroom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
been in here often when Mr. Abbott, Sr., used it as a
sitting room,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and these are the hunting
prints which Paul left me.&rdquo; He looked down at Mrs.
Nash, a faint smile still lingering about his lips. &ldquo;I
want these prints awfully. Please don&rsquo;t contest Paul&rsquo;s
will,&rdquo; and turning his back upon her, he walked
leisurely across the room and examined them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s emotions were too great to permit her
clear vision and she failed to detect Trenholm when
he quietly took down the sketch of neglected graves
which hung where Miriam had seen it during her
first vigil in the sick room. Slipping the small picture
inside his pocket, he strolled back to the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by, Mrs. Nash,&rdquo; he bowed courteously,
then bent further down until his lips nearly touched
her right ear. &ldquo;I am not much of a doctor, but I am
of the opinion that you can get up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Mrs. Nash recovered her breath only
Somers was in the bedroom.</p>

<span class="reduce">THE DEATH CLUTCH</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">iriam</span> did not stay long in her bedroom
after leaving Guy Trenholm in the hall
of Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge talking to Corbin.
She had thought at first of lying down for a little
while, but she was too restless. A walk would quiet
her nerves, and, if Mrs. Nash had a good night, she
might have an opportunity of relaxing and thereby
gain some rest before morning.</p>

<p>It took Miriam only a few minutes to put on her
coat and hat again and, not bothering to take gloves,
she went down the staircase. Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s door was
closed as she passed it and she wondered if Guy
Trenholm was still with her patient. She would
have given much to have been present at the interview.
Her thoughts veered back to Trenholm. She
must see him before he left. There was something
she must tell him, an idea which had come to her.
Should she stay in? Miriam wavered. If she waited
it would be too late to go out. Ah, she had it!
Martha would give Trenholm a message for her.</p>

<p>Knowing that Martha usually sat in a window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
nook just between the pantry and the dining room,
Miriam went in that direction but paused near the
dining room table at sight of Betty Carter standing
in the doorway leading to the sunparlor. She
doubted if Betty had heard her approach, for the
young girl&rsquo;s attention was riveted on Alan Mason,
who lay asleep in one of the long wicker lounging
chairs standing directly at the entrance to the dining
room.</p>

<p>Alan&rsquo;s comely features were free of the haggard
lines which had aged him in the past few days, and
his graceful pose in the abandon of sleep resembled
that of a tired boy after a day of play. Evidently
his dreams were happy, for a smile trembled on his
lips and he murmured softly, &ldquo;Betty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty Carter&rsquo;s eyes were dimmed with tears and
Miriam, glancing at her, read the carefully guarded
secret of her heart. Alan Mason, and not his dead
cousin, was the man she loved. With a swift, graceful
movement Betty stooped down and kissed him on
the forehead with a touch so delicate that it did not
awaken the sleeping man. Then, with a gesture of
utter despair, she dropped on her knees in front of a
chair and buried her face in her arms.</p>

<p>Miriam stole softly away, her desire to see Martha
forgotten in the scene she had inadvertently witnessed.
It had all happened in a second of time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
There had been no opportunity for her to withdraw,
but Miriam felt self-reproached. Walking rapidly,
head down, hands in pockets, she took no note of
her direction, save that she was on a footpath leading
away from Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, and she honestly tried
to banish Betty and Alan from her thoughts. But
one idea persisted and would not down. If Betty
loved Alan, why had she married Paul on Monday
night?</p>

<p>A high wind had sprung up and Miriam had forgotten
to use hatpins. The next second she was bareheaded.
Her hat, a chic affair of the mushroom
variety, sailed gracefully ahead of her around a curve
and then another and stronger gust of wind carried
it into a field on her left. With a disgusted ejaculation
over her stupidity in omitting the pins, Miriam
followed her hat as best she could. She had just
retrieved it and slapped it vigorously on her head,
regardless of the angle, when she espied a couple of
cows in the corner of the field. Miriam stopped not
on the order of her going and when she halted she
had reached the edge of a wood. Having a good
bump of locality, she recognized, after a careful
glance around, the wood as the one she and Trenholm
had walked through when returning from
Hills Bridge.</p>

<p>It was growing dark and Miriam faced in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
direction she judged Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge to be and hurried
along the path. In making the next turn she
paused abruptly. To her left lay the graveyard
which she had remarked upon to Trenholm. Its air
of desolation was emphasized by the fading light,
and Miriam did not plan to linger as she had done
when Trenholm was with her. But her intention to
hurry past the old Mason burying plot was checked
at sight of a man kneeling by a grave and digging
in it with a trowel. Miriam stopped short as the
man looked up. The recognition was mutual.</p>

<p>Corbin rose stiffly to his knees and, bending over,
brushed off some dirt and dry leaves which clung
to his trousers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How come ye here, Miss?&rdquo; he demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s first impulse was to decline to answer,
but Corbin had stepped back from the grave and
stood almost directly in front of her, blocking the
footpath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am out for a walk,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and by chance
came this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lonesome like, for a lady.&rdquo; Corbin hitched
himself a trifle closer, a beam of admiration in his
watery eyes, which Miriam found more objectionable
than a glare of rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are <i>you</i> doing here, Corbin?&rdquo; she asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
coolly taking the situation into her hands. &ldquo;What
interests you in these old graves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin shifted uneasily from one foot to the other.
&ldquo;Getting some ivy,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I wanted to
plant some around the garage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you rob a grave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin&rsquo;s complexion turned an even more unhealthy
color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the old suicide won&rsquo;t miss it,&rdquo; he said
coarsely, and hastily changed the subject. &ldquo;Funny,
weren&rsquo;t it, that Mr. Paul should ha&rsquo; left in his will
this here graveyard to Mr. Alan, &rsquo;cause it belonged
to his ancestors, and never given him nothin&rsquo; else,
&rsquo;cept five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam was not following closely Corbin&rsquo;s jumbled
accounts of the provisions of Paul&rsquo;s will, which
Mr. Corcoran had explained to Martha and to him
at the close of the reading of the will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who lies in this suicide&rsquo;s grave?&rdquo; she asked suddenly,
and the question took Corbin by surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Alan&rsquo;s grandfather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his name?&rdquo; with a persistence which surprised
herself as well as Corbin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cordin&rsquo; to the headstone his name was Mason,
too.&rdquo; Talking to an extremely pretty woman was a
novel sensation and Corbin was commencing to enjoy
himself. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a saying in these parts that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
stole some money when he was &rsquo;zecutor to a friend&rsquo;s
will and killed heself when found out. The niggers
buried him, as you see. Mr. Alan ain&rsquo;t got much call
to be proud of his gran&rsquo;-dad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think he will approve of your digging
into his grave,&rdquo; Miriam stated quietly, &ldquo;for ivy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin&rsquo;s lips curled back viciously over his yellow
teeth. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to hear of it,&rdquo; his voice grew
low and menacing. &ldquo;Not from you, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came a step nearer and his breath was unpleasantly
close. &ldquo;I gave the bloodstained sheet to
Sheriff Trenholm,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>Miriam stared at him, open-eyed. &ldquo;The bloodstained
sheet!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;What are you talking
about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sheet off Mr. Paul&rsquo;s bed after he was murdered,&rdquo;
with a slow, knowing wink, which sent the
hot blood to her cheeks. Her color ebbed as quickly
as it had come, leaving her deadly pale. &ldquo;The sheriff
was mighty curious to know if I had shown you
where to get clean linen for the bed when you fust
come. Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; observing her expression and
misinterpreting it. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t give him no direct
answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Corbin drew back at the force of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
exclamation. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell him <i>at once</i> that
you showed me the linen closet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leered at her. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any call for me
to give you away&mdash;then&rdquo;&mdash;he supplemented.</p>

<p>Miriam missed the last word. Her eyes were
blazing with indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you let Mr. Trenholm infer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What he pleased&mdash;yes, Miss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s small hands were clenched. &ldquo;You contemptible
cur!&rdquo; she cried, and would have added
more but wrath choked her utterance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Miss, don&rsquo;t you be so handy with misnamin&rsquo;
me,&rdquo; protested Corbin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got feelin&rsquo;s
like other fellows and I done ye a good turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By concealing the truth!&rdquo; scornfully. &ldquo;You are
not only a knave, Corbin, but a fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; Corbin&rsquo;s slow smile sent a shiver down
her back in spite of her hot anger. &ldquo;Come, Miss,
there ain&rsquo;t no use o&rsquo; you an&rsquo; me fussin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll stand
yer friend, if ye&rsquo;ll just give me a little snow&rdquo;&mdash;he
came nearer and brushed her shoulder with his
hand&mdash;&ldquo;just a little snow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam stared at Corbin. Was the man demented?
Her eyes left his face and fell on his hand as he
stood stroking her coat. It was a remarkably small
hand for a man, well-shaped, the long, creeping
fingers stained with soil from the grave. The seal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
ring on his third finger caught on a button as she
sprang back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin paid not the slightest attention to her command.
His eyes aflame with desire, he stepped after
Miriam and caught her hand, fawning upon her&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nurse, Miss,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;Gimme a
deck to-night.&rdquo; He saw her expression of dawning
comprehension and clung to her hand more tightly
than before.</p>

<p>Miriam wrenched her hand free. At last she
understood&mdash;Corbin was a cocaine addict. For the
first time she felt a twinge of fear as her glance
swept the lonely countryside. Of all the demoralizing
drugs, cocaine was the worst&mdash;whisky raised to
its nth power was pap compared to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have none, Corbin,&rdquo; she said, hiding her abhorrence
of the man under a brusque manner. &ldquo;We
nurses are no longer permitted to keep a supply of
narcotics on hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Roberts will let ye have a shot,&rdquo; eagerly.
&ldquo;Ye need never tell him it&rsquo;s for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to him yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corbin stared at her for a long moment, his bloodshot
eyes taking in her beauty appraisingly. The
collar of her coat had turned back and he caught a
glimpse of a gold chain. Martha had told him of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
rubies which she had seen around the nurse&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care o&rsquo; Roberts,&rdquo; he said thickly. &ldquo;But
me an&rsquo; you are goin&rsquo; to come to an understandin&rsquo;
right now. Hand over that gold chain. Ye won&rsquo;t!&mdash;then,
by God&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam had read the look in his eyes in time to
spring aside and avoid his clutching fingers. Far
more agile than her adversary, she eluded his attempt
to trip her and, fear lending wings to her feet, she
raced madly toward Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge.</p>

<p>Corbin&rsquo;s heart hammered and thumped as he
strove to overtake her. He was in no physical trim
and, as Miriam left the footpath and took to the
fields, he sank down by the roadside, panting from
his exertions. As he rested his brain cleared and he
cursed aloud as he realized the folly of his act. In
his mad craving for cocaine he had betrayed his
precious secret to Miriam. And she would tell.
Corbin ground his teeth in rage, then his face cleared.
Only Miriam knew&mdash;so far. When he got up and
limped toward Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge, his lips wrinkled in
a low and vicious smile.</p>

<p>Finally convinced that she had outdistanced Corbin,
Miriam dropped back to a walk. Considerably
shaken by the fright he had given her, it took her
some little time to stop looking over her shoulder to
see if the caretaker was still following her. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
her thoughts switched around to Guy Trenholm and
the bloodstained sheet, and her recent terror was
forgotten. Had Corbin, by his evasive answers to
the sheriff&rsquo;s question about the sheet, made Trenholm
believe that she was implicated in Paul Abbott&rsquo;s
murder? She recalled vividly his persistent questions
at his bungalow that afternoon as to whether
or not she had recognized Paul as the American
soldier to whom her uncle had intrusted the Paltoff
diamond.</p>

<p>Could it be that Trenholm suspected her of having
recognized Paul and seized the opportunity of being
alone with her patient to kill him and recover the
Paltoff diamond?</p>

<p>The thought was torment! Miriam brushed her
hair back from her forehead. She was suddenly
blinded by tears, and paused in uncertainty, unable
to go on. In that moment she realized what Guy
Trenholm had grown to be to her. Love&mdash;had she
given her love to a man unasked&mdash;unsought? Her
face flamed scarlet. Had romance come into her life
only to be bitter-sweet? She bowed her head in her
hands and the old, familiar prayer, which had sustained
her through the horrors of war and Russian
revolution, again passed her lips: &ldquo;God, give me
strength!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Miriam approached the entrance of Abbott&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
Lodge she was once more calm and collected. As she
stepped inside the house she was met by Martha.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wanted upstairs in Mr. Paul&rsquo;s old bedroom,&rdquo;
the housekeeper stated. &ldquo;They are waitin&rsquo;
for ye,&rdquo; and giving Miriam no chance to find out
who &ldquo;they&rdquo; were, she retreated to her kitchen, in time
to meet her husband slinking in the back door.</p>

<p>Considerably mystified by the message, Miriam
went first to her bedroom, tossed off her hat and
coat, and then paused long enough to arrange her
hair deftly, which had escaped from her hair net
when her hat blew off. Miriam had not been in
Paul&rsquo;s old bedroom since her interview with Trenholm
the night after the murder. The door had
always been closed and, never having tried to enter
it, she was not aware that, by the sheriff&rsquo;s orders, it
had been kept locked. However, she found it not
only unlocked, but wide open when she reached there,
and, without knocking, she stepped inside the room.</p>

<p>Seated near the table were Betty Carter and Guy
Trenholm, and, by their attitude, she judged that
they were awaiting her in growing impatience.
Miriam&rsquo;s heart beat a trifle faster as she met Trenholm&rsquo;s
straight gaze, but her manner was entirely
natural and composed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sent for me?&rdquo; she asked, addressing him
rather than Betty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>It was Betty who answered as Trenholm rose and
placed a chair for Miriam and, from a motive which
Miriam failed to guess and Trenholm himself to
analyze, stood by her side, his eyes watching every
play of emotion in Betty&rsquo;s beautiful face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sent for you, Miss Ward,&rdquo; Betty stated, &ldquo;and
for Sheriff Trenholm, because I wished to see him
in your presence,&rdquo; she faltered and grew paler. &ldquo;It
was before him that I flatly contradicted your statement
that I was here in this room with Paul on Monday
night. I wish to withdraw that denial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room swam around Miriam. It was the last
sentence she expected from Betty. She had exonerated
her and before Guy Trenholm. He would know
that she had not lied. She stole a look at him. Trenholm&rsquo;s
attention was entirely centered on Betty and
his expression was difficult to decipher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your motive for denying your presence here,
Miss Carter?&rdquo; he asked, and she winced at his tone
and the formality of his address. Her woman&rsquo;s
intuition told her that she could not sway him by
feminine wiles as in the old days in Paris. He had
developed from a shy country boy into a man, stern
perhaps, but just, resourceful and strong. &ldquo;What
was your motive?&rdquo; he asked again, with more emphasis,
as she kept silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The danger of being arrested for Paul&rsquo;s murder,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
she said, and this time it was Trenholm&rsquo;s turn to feel
astonishment, mingled with a reluctant admiration.
Betty, with characteristic courage, was taking the
ground from under his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your reason for such a fear?&rdquo; he questioned
swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My marriage to Paul under such peculiar circumstances
and my immediate departure, which
occurred,&rdquo; she added, addressing Miriam, whom surprise
had kept silent, &ldquo;judging from your testimony,
just before Paul was killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your departure just <i>before</i> he was killed is the
very point which clears you of all suspicion,&rdquo; declared
Trenholm dryly, and Betty changed color.
&ldquo;Come, Miss Carter, what has Paul&rsquo;s will to do with
your sudden admission of your marriage to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trenholm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please&mdash;no heroics!&rdquo; holding up an authoritative
hand. &ldquo;Let us have the truth at last, Miss Carter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s eyes blazed at him wrathfully. &ldquo;It is your
privilege to insult a woman, I presume&mdash;one of your
prequisites as sheriff of the County.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm smiled. &ldquo;Put it that way, if you wish,&rdquo;
he said, in entire good nature. &ldquo;By the terms of
Paul&rsquo;s will you inherit nothing if you marry after
his death; but, as his widow, the law allows you one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
third of his estate, irrespective of any will,&rdquo; he
paused&mdash;&ldquo;or any marriage thereafter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty rose and dropped him a curtsy, and Miriam,
watching her with a critic&rsquo;s eye, saw no tremor in
hands or lips and no evasive glance. &ldquo;You make me
out a very clever woman,&rdquo; Betty said. &ldquo;I thank
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm bowed. &ldquo;There is only one flaw in your
reasoning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You did not marry Paul
Abbott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty stared at him, astounded. &ldquo;Are you mad!&rdquo;
she gasped. &ldquo;Why, Miss Ward witnessed the
marriage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, but I was not in the room,&rdquo; interrupted
Miriam. &ldquo;Doctor Nash sent me to get a
lamp and I returned just as he completed the marriage
ceremony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty surveyed them both scornfully. &ldquo;What is
this&mdash;collusion?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, just statements of facts,&rdquo; retorted Trenholm.
&ldquo;When Miss Ward returned to this room after seeing
you depart, she went over to the bed and found,
not Paul, but a stranger lying there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty sank back in her chair. Her face was
ghastly. There was no make-believe in her emotion
and her half-fainting condition was genuine. With
a word of explanation, Miriam bolted out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
room, to return a second later with smelling salts.
Betty accepted them with a broken word of thanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she began, glancing piteously
from one to the other. &ldquo;You found a strange man
in Paul&rsquo;s bed just after I left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Miriam, quietly. &ldquo;It was a great
shock and I fainted, and in that condition was chloroformed.
When I revived I found Mr. Abbott lying
dead in that bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As in a daze, Betty raised her hands and pressed
them to her throbbing temples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that some man got in this room while
Miss Ward was in the hall with the lighted lamp,
showing Uncle Alexander and me the way downstairs,
threw Paul out of bed, and took his place?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;And being detected by Miss Ward,
chloroformed her, and then murdered Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have described the scene very admirably,&rdquo;
stated Trenholm, slowly, &ldquo;except in one particular.
The man assumed Paul&rsquo;s place in the bed when Miss
Ward went downstairs to the door to admit you and
Doctor Nash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s eyes were half starting
from her head. &ldquo;Why, I stood near the bed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly where?&rdquo; broke in Trenholm. &ldquo;Show
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty rose and walked over to the bed and paused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
by it. &ldquo;When I came, I stopped here,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;I did not move, did I, Miss Ward?&rdquo; glancing
appealingly at Miriam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how were the curtains of the four-poster
draped?&rdquo; asked Trenholm.</p>

<p>Miriam quickly arranged them to the best of her
recollection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Miss Carter, you did not have a good view
of the man in the bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it <i>was</i> Paul,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I knew his
voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voices can be imitated,&rdquo; Trenholm spoke slowly.
&ldquo;And a poor imitation would have passed muster in
your state of excitement. You were expecting to
find Paul there&mdash;and you were not critical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you I saw his face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His dark hair, his general contour&mdash;oh, pshaw,
his beard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see his eyes?&rdquo; asked Trenholm. &ldquo;Did
you lean over and kiss him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty flushed crimson, from throat to brow. &ldquo;He
kept his eyes closed&mdash;sick men do that&rdquo;&mdash;with a
defiant glance at Miriam as if challenging her to
contradict her statement. &ldquo;I, eh, I didn&rsquo;t kiss Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
because&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo; her voice died away and rose
again. &ldquo;He was ill and&mdash;eh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you loved another man!&rdquo; Trenholm&rsquo;s tone
cut like a whiplash, and she swayed upon her feet.
&ldquo;Come, confess that you consented to marry Paul
because he promised you the Paltoff diamond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three times Betty strove to speak. &ldquo;You are the
devil incarnate!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I tell you I married
Paul!&ldquo; Her clenched fist struck the bedstead a sharp
blow. &ldquo;See, look here,&rdquo; and from around her neck
she dragged off a gold chain which she had worn
concealed underneath her gown. From it was suspended
a heavy gold ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew Paul intimately, Guy Trenholm. Do
you recognize this ring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took it from her hand and Miriam moved
closer to his side and examined it intently. It bore
only a large and beautifully carved &ldquo;M&rdquo; upon it.
Trenholm dropped it in Miriam&rsquo;s hand and she was
astonished at the ring&rsquo;s weight and its massive size.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the ring&rsquo;s history, but Miss Ward does
not,&rdquo; went on Betty, as Trenholm kept silent. &ldquo;This
ring was Paul&rsquo;s fetish&mdash;he was intensely superstitious.
He declared that it would never leave his
possession until he placed it on my finger.&rdquo; She
drew in her breath. &ldquo;Paul made that statement in
your presence, Guy Trenholm, and in mine, and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
placed that ring on my finger during the marriage
service on Monday night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From his leather wallet Trenholm drew a number
of photographs and selected one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This photograph,&rdquo; he said, holding it so that both
girls could see it, &ldquo;was taken of Paul as he lay on
the undertaker&rsquo;s couch in the room down the hall,
and just before he was placed in the casket. You
will see that he is still wearing his seal ring&mdash;in fact,
his finger was so firmly bent to hold it upon his hand
that we would have had to break the bone to take it
off. His ring, Miss Carter, is buried with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty stared dumbly at him. Suddenly her
strength deserted her, and before Miriam could
catch her she fell in a crumpled heap at their feet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="reduce">WHICH?</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">renholm&rsquo;s</span> noiseless pacing back and
forth before Betty Carter&rsquo;s bedroom door
gave no evidence of the impatience consuming
him. Miriam Ward had promised to join him the
instant she was able to leave Betty. He had carried
the unconscious girl to her room and then gone in
search of Doctor Roberts, only to be told by Anna,
who in her capacity of temporary maid was setting
the dinner table, that Roberts and Alan Mason had
gone for a motor ride in the former&rsquo;s car earlier in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>Trenholm&rsquo;s restless walk drew him further and
further from Betty&rsquo;s room and when he finally
paused he found he was standing in front of the
closed door where Paul Abbott&rsquo;s body had lain until
the funeral. A hasty search in his pockets produced
the key of the room and a second later he was
inside it.</p>

<p>Trenholm took the pains to relock the door from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
the inside and to hang his handkerchief securely
over the door knob, thereby obstructing Corbin&rsquo;s
view of the interior of the room. The caretaker had
watched the sheriff from a respectful distance and,
on seeing him enter and close the door, he had stolen
down the hall and, first poking out the key in the lock
with a slender steel instrument, he applied his eye
to the keyhole, and saw nothing. With a grunt
indicative of acute disappointment, Corbin slipped up
to his living quarters in pursuit of his helpmate,
Martha.</p>

<p>When Trenholm reappeared in the hall his face
was set and stern. He paused, after locking the door
again and pocketing the key, to wipe tiny drops of
moisture from his forehead. Were his theories entirely
wrong? No, he would stake his reputation
that he was right, in spite of his last discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trenholm!&rdquo; Miriam touched him on the
arm and aroused him from his abstraction, an abstraction
so profound that he had never heard her
approach. &ldquo;Miss Carter has revived and is resting
quietly. I think it is safe to leave her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Trenholm&rsquo;s relief was unmistakable and
sincere. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Downstairs to see if Doctor Roberts has returned,&rdquo;
she said, as he walked with her. She looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
up at him impulsively. &ldquo;Miss Carter is suffering
horribly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you said that she was improving,&rdquo;
halting abruptly on the landing of the staircase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean mental agony. Mr. Trenholm, can&rsquo;t you
help her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i> ask that?&rdquo; The light in his eyes caused
her to catch her breath sharply, then her heart raced
on. &ldquo;Come, you have never told me whom you think
guilty of Paul&rsquo;s murder?&rdquo; He led the way into the
sunparlor, where Anna had lighted two of the lamps
before returning to the kitchen. Trenholm adjusted
the Holland shades and curtains before the windows
to his satisfaction, then sat down near Miriam.</p>

<p>She stared at him thoughtfully before speaking.
&ldquo;I learned only a few hours ago of the bloodstained
sheet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that Corbin was so treacherous
as to let you infer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He interrupted her hastily. &ldquo;My inferences or
deductions cleared you of any complicity in the
crime,&rdquo; his clear, strong voice and charming smile
dispelled her agonizing suspense. &ldquo;I never doubted
you, Miss Ward, <i>never</i>. Although the exigencies of
the case may have led me to imply otherwise, I never
lost faith in your integrity&mdash;your honor&mdash;your
splendid courage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>Trenholm and Miriam, who had sat enthralled
drinking in his words and the message which his
eyes spoke more eloquently than human lips, both
looked up to find Alexander Nash standing in the
doorway contemplating them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drove over to see you, Trenholm, but that rascally
servant of yours refused to tell me where you
were to be found,&rdquo; explained Nash. &ldquo;I then drove
to Upper Marlboro and the constable finally &lsquo;allowed&rsquo;
you might be here. Such crass stupidity has cost me
valuable time!&rdquo; And Nash, the usually polished,
suave clergyman as known in Washington and
Toronto church circles, flung himself into a chair
near Miriam, his face like a thundercloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why the excitement?&rdquo; asked Trenholm, regarding
him keenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a confession to make.&rdquo; Nash took out
his large silk handkerchief and dabbed his forehead.
&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go, Miss Ward&mdash;this interview holds as
much interest for you as it does for the sheriff. It
was in his presence that I told you that I failed to
recall certain incidents of Monday night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereby you lied,&rdquo; pointed out Miriam coolly,
and noted with relish Nash&rsquo;s apoplectic complexion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You use a harsh term, Miss Ward,&rdquo; he objected.
&ldquo;My statement was, strictly speaking, an evasion&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
did not deny that the incidents took place&mdash;simply
that I did not recall them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come to the point!&rdquo; Trenholm&rsquo;s tone was
not complimentary, and Nash squirmed in his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Carter and I were here on Monday night,&rdquo;
he began. &ldquo;And I did perform the marriage service&mdash;uniting
Paul and Betty in holy wedlock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash&rsquo;s statement did not create the excitement he
had anticipated and he looked from one to the other
of his companions in intense surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you talk with Paul?&rdquo; asked Trenholm
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not directly. Betty told him of my presence.
I stood a little distance from the bed&rdquo;&mdash;he
cleared his throat. &ldquo;Illness is upsetting to me.
I&mdash;eh&mdash;have a peculiar dread of&mdash;eh&mdash;disease.
Paul made the necessary responses&mdash;after he was&mdash;eh&mdash;duly
prompted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see!&rdquo; Trenholm was watching the agitated
clergyman with disconcerting attention. &ldquo;And what
was your motive in denying your visit to Paul on
Monday night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty met me on my way here Tuesday afternoon
and asked me not to tell of it&rdquo;&mdash;Nash started up
heatedly. &ldquo;Why are you glaring at me in that
offensive manner, Mr. Trenholm?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your first name Adam?&rdquo; asked the sheriff
dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Alexander,&rdquo; with indignant emphasis. &ldquo;I
see no occasion for levity, Mr. Trenholm. My wife
is devoted to her niece and so am I. I agreed to
carry out Betty&rsquo;s wishes, blindly it may be, and perhaps
foolishly, but my motive was to protect her
good name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explain your meaning.&rdquo; Trenholm was thoroughly
awake at last, and the clergyman could not
complain of not creating a sensation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty received a special letter from Paul just
before our departure from Toronto, telling of his
illness and begging her to hurry to him,&rdquo; went on
Nash. &ldquo;He feared that he might not recover and
desired her to marry him. Betty was frightfully
upset, and on our approach to Baltimore asked that
we leave the train there and catch the last train out
for Upper Marlboro. We did so, and on reaching
there I secured a Buick touring car from the local
livery&mdash;&rdquo; Trenholm nodded his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get on with your story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash favored him with a frown. &ldquo;I drove Betty
out here. We left the house, as Miss Ward knows,
before Paul&rsquo;s murder.&rdquo; He paused to clear his
throat again. &ldquo;I helped Betty into the back seat, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
the curtains were up and she was more protected
there, and, as the starter did not work, spent some
few minutes cranking the car. Without addressing
Betty again I headed the car for Washington and it
was not until we were nearly at Anacostia that I discovered
I was alone in the car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What became of Miss Carter?&rdquo; demanded Trenholm,
as Nash came to a dramatic pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume she left the car when I was stooping
over cranking it,&rdquo; explained Nash. &ldquo;She had arranged
the heavy laprobes so that they gave the
appearance of some one seated there.&rdquo; Nash waited
for comment from his companions, but none forthcoming,
he added, a trifle pettishly, &ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s disappearance
was a great shock, but I continued on my
way to Washington, wondering what I should do.
Then came the news of Paul&rsquo;s murder and I was
positively staggered. And to be greeted before I
reached Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge with Betty&rsquo;s piteous plea
that I say nothing of our visit here on Monday
night&mdash;why, it threw me entirely off my feet. For
the sake of Betty&mdash;for the fair name of my wife&rsquo;s
family&mdash;to save them from scandal&mdash;I kept silent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what has caused you to break that silence?&rdquo;
questioned Trenholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only to you,&rdquo; in alarm, &ldquo;and to Miss Ward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
I must ask you to pledge your word not to speak of
it outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why have you told us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you are investigating Paul&rsquo;s murder and
I feel that you should know all the facts of the
case.&rdquo; Nash sighed. &ldquo;I learned only this morning
from a reliable source that Betty spent Monday night
wandering about Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge and in the garage.
She walked to Upper Marlboro in time to catch the
milk train for Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you this, Doctor Nash?&rdquo; asked Trenholm
sternly. &ldquo;I insist upon an answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps you should know&mdash;&rdquo; somewhat
doubtfully. &ldquo;Corbin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm sat back and contemplated the clergyman.
&ldquo;Corbin,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Thank you, Doctor
Nash,&rdquo; as the latter rose. &ldquo;How is your wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so well.&rdquo; Nash&rsquo;s face clouded over. &ldquo;I am
going to stop and see her now,&rdquo; he said, and with a
polite bow to Miriam, he left them.</p>

<p>Trenholm waited until he was sure Nash had had
time to reach the second floor before addressing
Miriam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t admire our reverend friend?&rdquo; he
asked, noting with secret amusement her wrathful
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he is horrid!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;So&mdash;so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
slimy. And Mrs. Nash is so straightforward and
absolutely sincere.&rdquo; Hastily she changed the subject.
&ldquo;How did that last code message read?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm looked carefully around before answering
her, to be sure they were alone, then approaching
close to her side, whispered it in her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Watch thirteenth letter. Suicides grave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds like gibberish,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Do
you still think it refers to the thirteenth letter of the
alphabet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; firmly. &ldquo;And quite appropriately so,&rdquo; he
went on slowly, &ldquo;when it commences such words as
morphine, murder, madness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mason,&rdquo; she completed, quietly. &ldquo;But, Mr.
Trenholm, it&rsquo;s a poor rule that doesn&rsquo;t work both
ways&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; as she paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Counting the alphabet from A to M is thirteen,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But counting from M to A the thirteenth
letter is <i>A</i>.&rdquo; She looked at him queerly. &ldquo;<i>Alexander</i>
Nash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not Alan Mason&mdash;counting <i>both</i> ways his
initials make the number thirteen?&rdquo; Trenholm
stuffed his hands into his pockets and gazed at her
tall, shapely figure, her clear, olive skin, and her great
beautiful eyes, and was conscious of an accelerated
pulse. He came a step closer. &ldquo;I have learned that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
Alan was on the troopship from Vladivostok with
his cousin Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started and stared at him aghast. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
believe Mr. Mason had a hand in the murder,&rdquo; she
declared vehemently. &ldquo;Call it instinct&mdash;or what you
will&mdash;I believe absolutely that Mr. Abbott&rsquo;s murder
was planned and carried out by Boris Zybinn, and
I cannot forget that Alexander Nash was Zybinn&rsquo;s
neighbor in Toronto. Tell me,&rdquo; she came closer to
his side, &ldquo;has Doctor Nash a parish in Washington?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;nor in Toronto.&rdquo; Trenholm stroked his
chin reflectively. &ldquo;I understand that he was a man
of considerable means before he married Representative
Carter&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;and that in spite of the difference
in their ages, it was a love match, pure and
simple. I think Paul told me that Doctor Nash had
retired from the ministry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-o-h!&rdquo; Miriam&rsquo;s exclamation was long-drawn
out and Trenholm stared. She gave him no opportunity
to question her further. &ldquo;To go back to the
coded message,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;have you thought the
words &lsquo;suicides grave&rsquo; have any connection with the
Mason plot out yonder and the poor suicide&mdash;that
makes the thirteenth grave&mdash;as you pointed out the
other day, in that neglected family cemetery?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Trenholm looked at her keenly. &ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo;
he replied, and wondered at her disappointment.
&ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walked by the graveyard just now,&rdquo; she said
hurriedly, &ldquo;and was amazed to see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Miss&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;&mdash;Martha&rsquo;s complaining
voice caused Miriam to jump&mdash;startled by
the woman&rsquo;s proximity. &ldquo;Dinner will be ready in a
minute. I&rsquo;ve just telled the folks upstairs, and
thought mebbe you&rsquo;d like to know. There&rsquo;s a couple
o&rsquo; boys outside inquirin&rsquo; for ye, Sheriff,&rdquo; and, her
message delivered, Martha took herself off.</p>

<p>Trenholm caught up with her before she reached
the kitchen, and drew her to one side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Martha!&rdquo; His low stern voice sent a shiver down
the woman&rsquo;s back, and the pressure of his hand on
her arm tightened. &ldquo;When did this letter reach Mr.
Paul?&rdquo; and he held before her the thirteenth letter.
&ldquo;No lies, now. I want the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Martha&rsquo;s quavering tones did not belie
her feelings. &ldquo;Please, sir, that there letter with them
queer stamps come the morning Mr. Paul was killed,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No go, Martha,&rdquo; Trenholm shook her slightly.
&ldquo;The postmark shows this letter should have reached
Upper Marlboro last week.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she whined. &ldquo;But by
mistake it was put in Anna&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s box by the
carrier; an&rsquo; havin&rsquo; sickness in the family, Anna only
brought it up on Monday mornin&rsquo;. I took it from
her, sir, and went right up to the room where Mr.
Paul was talkin&rsquo; to Mr. Alan&mdash;an&rsquo; laid it on the
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Alan!&rdquo; Trenholm strove to keep his voice
lowered. &ldquo;Was he here then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. Paul sent for him,&rdquo; she looked
up craftily. &ldquo;He stayed &rsquo;round most of the day
until &rsquo;bout time the doctor was to come, and then
he cleared out.&rdquo; She raised herself on tiptoe and
whispered as he bent down to hear her better. &ldquo;Corbin
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t here then. He&rsquo;d kill me if he knew I
was keepin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; from him. But Mr. Alan,&rdquo;
her voice held unexpected, unmistakable pathos,
&ldquo;years back, he beat Corbin for mishandlin&rsquo; me, and
I ain&rsquo;t never forgot how good he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Trenholm took out his handkerchief and
handed it to her. &ldquo;Dry your eyes, Martha; and say
nothing about Mr. Alan or this letter&rdquo;&mdash;returning
it to his pocket. &ldquo;Remember I trust you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Martha drew a long, long breath. Trenholm was
treating her like a human being. Gratitude, mingled
with a return of self-respect, caused her to raise his
hand to her lips, then, in frantic bashfulness, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
slipped back into the dining room, upsetting Anna
in her hurried entrance.</p>

<p>Trenholm paused in deep thought, then, going
through the side door, joined the three deputies who
were anxiously awaiting him. His concise directions
were listened to with the respect which Trenholm
inspired among those who worked with and for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; he said finally, and the men
nodded as they stood grouped about him. &ldquo;Riley,
go to the telegraph office and await the answers to
the messages I have sent and bring them to me.
Do not permit them to telephone any message to me;
there is too much danger of &lsquo;listening in.&rsquo; Now, be
off,&rdquo; and Trenholm again entered Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge,
but by the front door.</p>

<p>Trenholm&rsquo;s entrance went unnoticed by Doctor
Roberts and Alan Mason, who were chatting with
Miriam, while Alexander Nash stood moodily contemplating
the blazing logs on the hearth at the
further end of the living room, deaf alike to his
companions and Anna&rsquo;s announcement that dinner
was served.</p>

<p>With old-fashioned courtesy, Roberts offered his
arm to Miriam, then paused abruptly as footsteps
on the staircase caused him to glance upward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; he ejaculated in complete
surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>Coming down the staircase, with the assistance of
a flurried Somers, was Mrs. Nash. She had donned
a pretty negligée, and the excitement and her exertions
combined had brought the color to her face.
Miriam hastened to Somers&rsquo; assistance and Roberts
was immediately behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is most imprudent, Mrs. Nash!&rdquo; he exclaimed
sternly. &ldquo;In your condition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo; Mrs. Nash snapped her fingers. &ldquo;I am
getting on famously. Don&rsquo;t be pessimistic, Doctor;
instead, you should congratulate me upon my recovery.
Thank you, my dear,&rdquo; as Miriam helped
her toward the dining room. &ldquo;Come here, Alexander,
and give me your arm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At sound of her voice, the clergyman wheeled
around and stepped backward with such suddenness
that he walked on the fire tongs and fender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dora&mdash;here! Have you taken leave of your
senses?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem the only one to have retained my senses,&rdquo;
she retorted tartly. &ldquo;Miss Ward, you were always
assuring me I was not very ill, but judging from
Doctor Roberts&rsquo; conduct and my husband&rsquo;s, they
must have thought me at the point of death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nash collected his scattered wits and came forward.
&ldquo;I suppose you will have your way, though
the skies fall,&rdquo; he said resignedly. &ldquo;But I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
have thought, my dear, that poor Zybinn&rsquo;s sudden
death through imprudent neglect of his health would
have warned you to be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What rejoinder Mrs. Nash made was lost by
Trenholm, who had stood out of sight behind the
grandfather clock watching the scene. He waited
until, judging from the sounds that came from the
other room, they were seated around the dinner table,
and then, taking care to make no noise, he ran
lightly up the staircase and darted into Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s
bedroom.</p>

<p>Before going to her supper, Somers had aired
the room and remade the bed, and Trenholm&rsquo;s electric
torch showed everything in order. First convincing
himself that he was the only person in the
bedroom, he went over to the wall and taking from
his pocket the pen and ink drawing which he had
carried away almost under Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s nose, he
hung it back in its place.</p>

<p>Trenholm laid down his torch on a convenient
chair and drew out the thirteenth letter. He had
inserted a little paste under the flap before leaving
his bungalow, and to all intents and purposes the
envelope looked as if it never had been opened.
Holding it in his hand, he scanned the bedroom
eagerly and spied a dustpan and brush which Somers
had carelessly forgotten and left standing by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
bureau. Trenholm slipped over to it and laid the
envelope on the small pile of trash in the pan. When
he had arranged it to his liking, the envelope looked
as if it had been brushed up with the rest of the
trash, but the Canadian stamps were plainly in view.</p>

<p>Trenholm stood up and, taking his torch with
him, tiptoed to the hall door which he had left open
as he had found it. A glance outside showed that
the hall was empty. Looking about the bedroom,
Trenholm noticed a screen which Somers had
brought into the bedroom and stood between Mrs.
Nash and an open window. It would make an excellent
hiding place. Like a flash he was behind it.
From where he crouched, he had an excellent view
of the open door and the entire bedroom. Trenholm
drew a long breath&mdash;the stage was set, and he had
staked all on the fall of the dice!</p>

<p>Half an hour passed and he was commencing to
worry when a light footfall came down the hall and
he heard Betty Carter exclaim at sight of the darkened
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somers!&rdquo; she called, very softly. Getting no reply,
she peered into the room and then very cautiously
came inside it. A startled exclamation,
quickly suppressed, escaped her at sight of the empty
bed, and she drew back and glanced hastily over
her shoulder. Gathering courage from the continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
stillness, she went over to the bureau and
fumbled in one of the drawers. Something fell from
her hand&mdash;from Trenholm&rsquo;s position he could not
see what, and he dared not move&mdash;and she struck a
match. Shielding it in her hand, she stooped over.
She remained so long in that position that Trenholm
grew alarmed; then, with a swiftness and
stealth which left him breathless, she was gone.</p>

<p>Had Betty taken the thirteenth letter? Trenholm
was on edge, but, before he dared venture out, another
figure stood in the doorway, and by the light
from the hall lamp, he recognized Miriam. Without
hesitation she went at once to the bureau and
opening the second drawer took out one of Mrs.
Nash&rsquo;s scarfs. Would she see the envelope and,
thinking it had accidentally fallen in the dustpan,
pick it up? Or was it not there for her to pick up?
Trenholm heaved a sigh of thankfulness when Miriam
turned and went into the hall.</p>

<p>A stealthy step inside the bedroom a few seconds
later caused Trenholm again to draw back into the
shelter of the screen in time to miss being seen by
Corbin. The caretaker had advanced only a few
paces when a hand was laid on his shoulder and he
was jerked back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Sacré Dieu!</i> What do you in my mistress&rsquo;
bedroom, <i>cochon</i>?&rdquo; hissed Pierre in his ear. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
answer the terrified man would have made was
checked by Alexander Nash&rsquo;s voice in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pierre, bring the car around!&rdquo; Nash failed to
see the two men, chauffeur and caretaker, steal out
of his wife&rsquo;s doorway, for he turned at the moment
to address Alan Mason&mdash;only to find that the young
man had disappeared. Nash hesitated for a fraction
of a second, then tiptoed down the hall.</p>

<p>Trenholm&rsquo;s sensitive ears caught the creak of a
floor board, and the faint &ldquo;seep&mdash;seep&rdquo; of something
being dragged across the floor. A flood of light
from an electric torch half blinded him, accustomed
to the almost total darkness of the room, and he
rubbed his eyes to clear his vision, just as the light
was focused full upon the dustpan. The thirteenth
letter stood out in bold relief. The light was dimmed
instantly and again Trenholm caught the sound of
something creeping across the floor.</p>

<p>The light flared up again with unexpected swiftness
and Trenholm saw a shapeless figure, its head
and shoulders enveloped in some black garment,
squatting over the dustpan. The torch lay at rest
by it, and Trenholm had a glimpse of long, slender
fingers holding the letter as he crept from behind
the screen and as noiseless as the shadows about
him, reached the kneeling figure. The stamped envelope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
was held in one hand and in the other was a
perforation gauge&mdash;</p>

<p>With lightning swiftness Trenholm snapped the
handcuffs on the two upraised wrists. With a sweep
of his arm, he drew back the black, shroudlike garment,
as he cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of the law I arrest you for the
murder of Paul Abbott&rdquo;&mdash;Trenholm&rsquo;s voice died
away at sight of the distorted, ghastly face confronting
him, then rose in horror&mdash;&ldquo;Doctor Roberts.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="reduce">THE RULING PASSION</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smcap">etty Carter</span>, too unhappy to keep to
her room, where she had found bed intolerable
after recovering from her faint, was
the first to hear Roberts&rsquo; frantic cries for mercy as
Trenholm got him upon his feet and half dragged,
half lifted his prisoner into a chair. She stood
aghast in the doorway of Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s bedroom until
pushed further inside by Alan Mason and Doctor
Nash, who had paused to pick up a lighted lamp
and carried it with him. Mrs. Nash, leaning heavily
on Miriam&rsquo;s arm, was likewise not slow in reaching
her room, while Martha was only restrained from
racing upstairs also by a terrified Anna, whose detaining
clutch she could not loosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; Alan dashed to Trenholm&rsquo;s side as
Roberts, his paroxysm over, sank weakly back in his
chair and covered his face with his manacled hands.
&ldquo;What is the meaning of this, Guy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Roberts murdered Paul Abbott,&rdquo; stated
Trenholm, and his announcement created a profound
sensation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash dropped into the nearest seat, for once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
bereft of speech, while Alan, his face transfigured,
stumbled over to Betty, and kneeling, pressed her
hand to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty, my darling!&rdquo; he exclaimed incoherently.
&ldquo;I knew that you were here on Monday night, and
then you denied your visit. Corbin told me that
you had bribed him into giving up your bloodstained
scarf. God forgive me! I was afraid that you had
killed Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not reproach yourself too much,&rdquo; she said,
and her soft, clear voice held its old accustomed
thrill. Unmindful of the presence of the others, she
drew him to his feet and his arms encircled her.
&ldquo;I did you a greater wrong, Alan, when I married
Paul, while my heart was given to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not marry Paul&mdash;you married me,&rdquo;
declared Alan, and but for his supporting arm Betty
would have fallen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;she married you!&rdquo; Mrs. Nash was getting
her fill of excitement. With eyes half starting from
her head, she gazed at her niece and Alan. &ldquo;You&mdash;Alan&rdquo;&mdash;while
her husband feebly echoed her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;facing their concentrated regard with
head thrown back, his face alight with hope and
love, Alan&rsquo;s voice rang out clearly. &ldquo;Paul sent for
me and I spent Monday morning with him. Just
before I left came your telegram, Betty, saying that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
you and Nash were on your way here and that you
would marry him. It was a frightful shock, and
for hours I wandered about the countryside, keeping
out of people&rsquo;s way. I determined to see Paul again
and tell him of my passionate love for you, Betty&mdash;&rdquo; he
sighed. &ldquo;I must have been a bit mad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty pressed his hand. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she begged;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reached here after midnight and knocked on
the side door, but could not arouse Corbin,&rdquo; continued
Alan. &ldquo;Paul and I had often entered the
house in the old days when he had forgotten his
doorkey, by climbing up to the veranda roof and
entering a window of his room. As I reached his
window, which was conveniently open, I heard the
front door bell ring loudly. I judged it was Betty
arriving with Doctor Nash and, pausing to take off
my muddy shoes and overcoat, I left them outside
on the roof, and then dropped inside the bedroom
and rushed over to speak to Paul. The bed was
empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; Miriam stared, astounded, at
Alan. &ldquo;Where was Mr. Abbott?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted Alan. &ldquo;At the time I
supposed he was out in the hall, as I could hear
voices. When they came closer I climbed into the
empty bed, to avoid being seen, and pulled the bedclothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
up over me. I couldn&rsquo;t face Betty and Paul
in their, what I supposed to be, hour of happiness.
I was horrified when Betty and Nash came directly
into the bedroom, and I suddenly realized that they
took me for Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you wearing a false beard?&rdquo; asked Trenholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not a false one. I had let my beard grow
for the past two weeks,&rdquo; explained Alan, &ldquo;and shaved
it off on Tuesday morning. To go back to the
scene in the bedroom&mdash;the lamp had gone out, and
except for the firelight the room was dark, and I
prayed that Betty would leave without recognizing
me. Before I could collect my senses, Doctor Nash
read the marriage service&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you made the responses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; the doctor prompted me.&rdquo; Alan flushed
hotly, then paled. &ldquo;I think I was mad that night.
My voice is like Paul&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was your greatest point of resemblance,&rdquo; commented
Trenholm, &ldquo;and the recollection of it finally
gave me the key to the situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan turned to Miriam and spoke with honest
contrition. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that Paul had a nurse,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t here in the morning. I was
still lying in Paul&rsquo;s bed, trying dazedly to plan something&mdash;anything&mdash;when
I heard some one return and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
walk swiftly to the bed. I heard your outcry and
the sound of your fall, and,&rdquo; in shame-faced honesty,
&ldquo;I bolted out of the window, gathered up my
hat, coat and shoes, and fled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; broke in Trenholm. &ldquo;How
about the ring you gave Miss Carter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan eyed him in surprise. &ldquo;Oh, the ring?&rdquo; he
echoed. &ldquo;Paul gave it to me Monday morning&mdash;that
was why I happened to have it about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why did Paul give you a ring which he
valued with almost superstitious fervor?&rdquo; inquired
Trenholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his original ring, but an exact replica
which, Paul told me on Monday, he had had made
for me. The original ring was a gold coin of the
First century of the Christian era and belonged to
my grandfather, another Alan Mason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The suicide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan winced slightly as he bowed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
Paul&rsquo;s motive in having the ring copied for me&mdash;he
often did freakish, unaccountable things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His remarks were checked by an exclamation from
Roberts, who had regained some semblance of self-control
while listening to Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no accounting for what Paul would
do,&rdquo; he stated, and all eyes turned to him, partly
in curiosity, but more in unconcealed horror. &ldquo;I may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
as well make my confession now as later,&rdquo; he sighed.
&ldquo;After I left Abbott&rsquo;s Lodge I motored to Upper
Marlboro, deciding, as it was such a bad night, that
I would remain at the hotel. It was before midnight
when Corbin came in and told me that a letter
had come that day from Canada from Zybinn and
that he had taken it, with other papers, to the room
Paul used as a sitting room. I gave Corbin his
customary bribe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cocaine,&rdquo; interposed Miriam quickly, and Roberts
nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took Corbin&rsquo;s key to the front door,&rdquo; he went
on, speaking with more of an effort, &ldquo;and came back
to find the letter which,&rdquo; turning with a scowl to
Trenholm, &ldquo;with your infernal astuteness, you divined
bore a stamp code. You planted that letter
and this trap&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; admitted Trenholm quietly. &ldquo;I realized
that the thirteenth letter had not been read either
by Paul or the person for whom the code was intended.
Knowing that attempts had been made to
steal something from this room, I judged that the
letter had been lost here, and so&rdquo;&mdash;with a quiet
smile at Mrs. Nash&mdash;&ldquo;I arranged to have the room
vacated for an hour or two. I knew whoever would
attempt to steal that letter had killed Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; demanded Doctor Nash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the stamp code tells where Paul had
secreted the Paltoff diamond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does!&rdquo; Roberts was on his feet; his features
distorted. &ldquo;Good God! to think that I failed by
so short a margin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; directed Trenholm, with a significant
pressure on the physician&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What
did you do, Roberts, when you reached Abbott&rsquo;s
Lodge on Monday night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stole softly up here.&rdquo; Roberts moistened his
parched lips. &ldquo;I found the letter which Corbin had
placed on the table and took up the nut pick, intending
to open the envelope, take out the letter and
leave it, and study the stamp code at my leisure at
the hotel. A noise at my elbow caused me to glance
around&mdash;Paul was standing at my side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;what next?&rdquo; prompted Trenholm, as Roberts
ceased speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My face must have betrayed me,&rdquo; he continued,
a second later. &ldquo;Paul&rsquo;s unexpected appearance
shocked me out of my self-control. He turned, I
suppose to call for help, and I drove the nut pick
into his back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause which none cared to break.
Roberts wiped some perspiration from his forehead
and then spoke more rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stood gazing down at the dead man, for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
had turned out the lamp which I had lighted only
a second before, and waited in the dark, my brain
whirling. Paul had left the door partly open and
I not only heard but saw Betty and Nash and Miss
Ward enter Paul&rsquo;s bedroom. Every instant I expected
to hear an outcry when they discovered Paul
was not in the bed. The suspense was something
frightful&rdquo;&mdash;his voice shook, and he steadied it with
an effort. &ldquo;Peering out from behind the door I saw
Nash and Betty leave, and Miss Ward return to
Paul&rsquo;s bedroom. There followed a slight cry, a
heavy fall, and then silence. I waited for a second
or two, then crept across the hall and into the bedroom.
Miss Ward was lying in a faint on the floor,
and Paul&rsquo;s bed was empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, fearing she would revive too soon, you
chloroformed her and carried Paul&rsquo;s dead body into
the room and put it into his bed,&rdquo; completed Trenholm,
as Roberts broke down, unable to go on.
&ldquo;How did you lose the letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it is the one confused incident
of the night,&rdquo; replied Roberts, after some hesitation.
&ldquo;The letter must have flown out of my hand as I
struck at Paul.&rdquo; Roberts sighed heavily. &ldquo;It happened
that Paul fell on some soiled sheets which
Martha had thrown on the floor, intending to take
away the next morning. I used the sheets and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
woman&rsquo;s scarf to staunch the flow of blood and
gave them, with my driving gloves, which I had
not removed, to Corbin to destroy. There was nothing
to indicate that Paul had been in this bedroom,
nothing to link me with the crime.&rdquo; Roberts sighed
again. &ldquo;Then an overwhelming terror and an unspeakable
horror of what I had done drove me out of
the house and I did not come again into this bedroom
to make a search for the letter. The next
morning Alan and Trenholm and the coroner gave
me no time alone, and then came Mrs. Nash and
she was put in here&mdash;and with her awake in the daytime
and Miss Ward on duty at night&rdquo;&mdash;Roberts&rsquo;
gesture was eloquent as he looked at Trenholm.
&ldquo;Well, you beat me. But I&rsquo;d like to know where
you found the letter and how you discovered the
code.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Ward did both,&rdquo; replied Trenholm as they
looked at him. &ldquo;She found the letter in that chair,&rdquo;
pointing to it, &ldquo;tucked under the upholstery and the
seat cushion where it evidently had fallen; and she
suspected that a code was concealed in the peculiar
use of five one-cent Canadian stamps, in place of the
regular three-cent postage, on thirteen letters. We
deciphered the code&mdash;and this message:&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Roberts eagerly, as he paused.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Watch thirteenth letter suicides grave,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated
Trenholm, and his listeners gazed at him
blankly. Turning abruptly to Betty, he addressed
her. &ldquo;Did you take some photographs of this house
a little while ago, and one of this room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Just before I went
to Canada, and Mr. Zybinn developed the negatives
for me. He was a paralytic, and while unable to
walk, dabbled in photography. He had some enlargements
made of my kodak films.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And one of this room?&rdquo; quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He said it was a remarkably good interior
and made me describe all the objects in it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Especially this&rdquo;&mdash;going over to the wall, Trenholm
took down a picture and held it in plain view.
He stopped as the constable and Riley came into
the bedroom, the latter with a sheaf of telegrams
in his hand. &ldquo;Ah, Constable, you are just in time&mdash;this
picture was made by Paul&rsquo;s mother, who was an
artist of some ability. She modeled it after those
quaint Swiss paintings of a cemetery with a church
in the background, in which a <i>real</i> clock was put in
the tower. In this picture of the Masons&rsquo; neglected
burying ground, Mrs. Abbott etched in the background
a church tower and <i>placed in the tower this
antique watch</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm turned the picture around and pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
to a watch, a tiny affair, which was firmly held in
the canvas by a clever contrivance. He drew out
the watch with a careful hand, the others watching
him breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first word of the code is &lsquo;watch.&rsquo; Here it
is,&rdquo; Trenholm held up the antique watch. &ldquo;The
next two words, &lsquo;thirteenth letter,&rsquo; which is &lsquo;M&rsquo;, you
will find is the initial engraved on the back of the
watch; and the last two words, &lsquo;suicide&rsquo;s grave,&rsquo;
exemplified by this picture of Colonel Mason&rsquo;s
grave.&rdquo; Trenholm turned to Betty and asked: &ldquo;Did
you not tell Zybinn that you chanced to see Paul
remove the works from this watch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Zybinn asked me if the
watch was too old to keep accurate time and I told
him Paul had taken it apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that was it,&rdquo; and Trenholm nodded. &ldquo;Paul
removed the works from the watch because he evidently
judged it to be an admirable hiding place
for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Paltoff diamond!&rdquo; shouted Roberts.</p>

<p>For answer Trenholm opened the watch. Inside
the round hollow lay a wad of cotton&mdash;and on top
of it the lost jewel.</p>

<p>They gathered about the table, even Roberts, forgetful
for a brief second that he was handcuffed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
and gazed at the beautiful gem, dazzled by its luster
and purity.</p>

<p>Trenholm was the first to speak. &ldquo;Paul knew little
rest after the Paltoff diamond was intrusted to his
care. He was constantly haunted by a morbid fear
of losing it or of being robbed of it, so that he
could never be induced to exhibit it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He showed it to Betty and to me,&rdquo; declared Mrs.
Nash, breaking her long silence. &ldquo;And swore us to
absolute secrecy. I greatly feared,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that
Betty was in some way mixed up in the tragedy
and my husband&rsquo;s extraordinary denial of their presence
here on Monday, when Pierre had brought me
Betty&rsquo;s telegram to Paul, fed my imagination&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I
dropped that note to you, Mr. Trenholm,
and&mdash;&rdquo; not meeting her husband&rsquo;s reproachful
glance, but looking instead at Miriam&mdash;&ldquo;I took surreptitious
doses of phenacetin and accidentally overdid
it and nearly killed myself, but,&rdquo; with a return
of her old arrogant air, &ldquo;I was determined to find
out what was going on in this house, whatever the
consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Trenholm concealed a smile, and then
grew grave. &ldquo;The usual ill-luck, apparently inseparable
from the possession of great diamonds, has
overtaken Paul,&rdquo; he said sorrowfully. &ldquo;He remained
true to his trust and never parted with the jewel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
Miss Ward,&rdquo; with an abruptness which startled her
from her study of Roberts, whose eyes had never
left the diamond, &ldquo;your uncle, M. Paltoff, gave the
gem to Paul&mdash;they are both dead&mdash;what do you wish
done with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not prevent a shudder. &ldquo;I cannot take
it,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Can you not turn it over to the
Department of State and let the Government decide
as to its disposition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An excellent suggestion.&rdquo; Trenholm, after replacing
the diamond in its hiding place, secreted the
watch carefully in an inside pocket. &ldquo;Stand back,
Roberts,&rdquo; as the physician made an effort to wrench
it from him. &ldquo;You will go with the constable and
Riley, but first,&rdquo; his voice deepened, &ldquo;how was it
that you, supposedly a reputable physician and a man
of honor, joined Zybinn in his endeavor to steal the
Paltoff diamond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Roberts turned sullenly, the veneer gone; and a
criminal, crafty and sinister-eyed, faced them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a drug addict,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I became
so two years ago after a nervous breakdown. I was
ship&rsquo;s surgeon on the transport with Paul. He sent
for me and I removed the diamond from the wound
in his leg. I was straight then. My practice had
fallen off; I was, in fact, a ruined man when, on a
visit to Doctor Nash, I met Zybinn. He wormed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
Paul&rsquo;s secret out of me, and promised, if I would
steal the jewel, to give me half the value of the
diamond. I knew he had money, for he had deposited
a large fortune in a bank in Toronto before
fleeing from Russia after a quarrel with Lenin.
Zybinn pointed out that the diamond was too celebrated
to be negotiable in the usual channels, and
that, cut into smaller stones, it would lose most of its
value, and so I agreed to his terms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why the stamp code?&rdquo; asked Trenholm, as
Roberts came to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Nash had employed me to travel with
Paul and keep him under observation, and it was
thought wiser for Zybinn not to communicate directly
with me,&rdquo; Roberts turned to Miriam. &ldquo;A glass
of water, please.&rdquo; Riley got it for him, before
Miriam could move, from the pitcher placed for Mrs.
Nash&rsquo;s use on the bedstand.</p>

<p>Roberts looked over at Betty, a malignant grin
distorting his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zybinn used you as a cat&rsquo;s paw,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Through you he gained an intimate knowledge of
Paul&rsquo;s habits, his mode of life, and, using his remarkable
powers of deduction, twice located the
hiding place of the diamond&mdash;in each instance too
late, for Paul&rsquo;s capricious habits, his secretiveness,
yes,&rdquo; with grudging admiration, &ldquo;his cleverness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
balked us. And so did you,&rdquo; wheeling on Mrs. Nash
with a suddenness which made her jump. &ldquo;I tried
to secure the thirteenth letter on Tuesday night, but
Martha detected me, and last night you pulled off
my disguise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you risk discovery?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Nash.
&ldquo;Why not have telegraphed to Zybinn for the message
on his last letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I telephoned from Washington on Tuesday and
was told he had died from apoplexy on Monday
afternoon&mdash;his third stroke,&rdquo; added Roberts. &ldquo;That
message on his letter to Paul was Zybinn&rsquo;s last word
to me. He thought I was still here at Abbott&rsquo;s
Lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; broke in Trenholm. &ldquo;Why did
Zybinn use the words &lsquo;thirteenth letter&rsquo; to designate
the initial &lsquo;M&rsquo; on the back of the watch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because in devising our code we failed to make
provision for indicating an initial, expecting never
to use one.&rdquo; Roberts chafed one cold hand over the
other. &ldquo;Had I decoded Zybinn&rsquo;s last message, I&rsquo;d
have gotten his meaning, however, for that little
sketch is the only painting by Paul&rsquo;s mother on the
premises and always cherished by her son. He
invariably spoke of the sketch as &lsquo;The Suicide&rsquo;s
Grave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I told Zybinn that,&rdquo; admitted Betty. &ldquo;Great
heavens! how I played into his hands&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so!&rdquo; agreed Roberts with sneering emphasis.
He straightened up, swayed slightly and recovered
his balance with an effort. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; addressing
Trenholm, &ldquo;I can stand no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The constable was by his side and Riley at his
heels instantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take him to Upper Marlboro,
sir,&rdquo; the former stated, and at a nod from
Trenholm, Roberts, with eyes averted from his
former friends, left the room, the black shroudlike
cloth still thrown about his shoulders&mdash;typical in its
vague outlines of the shadowed and complex nature
of the man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nash&rsquo;s overcharged feelings found relief in
tears. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as her distracted husband
held a glass of water and Miriam the smelling
salts. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be myself in a minute. Betty, come and
tell me why you remained here, instead of returning
to Washington with your uncle, and why you lied
about your visit to Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty cleared her throat. &ldquo;You were partly responsible&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; her aunt regarded her in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. After leaving the house I remembered my
promise to Uncle Alexander to telephone you why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
we were detained, and while he was cranking the
car, I jumped out and rang the bell. No one came
and I waited and rang again. Looking around I
saw that Uncle had driven off. I tried to overtake
him and failed, so spent the night here in Paul&rsquo;s
garage, the door being unlocked. Martha found me
there in the morning and gave me some breakfast.
She told me Paul had been murdered. It was a
frightful shock!&rdquo; Betty drew in her breath. &ldquo;And
I lost my head and ran away; and, to make bad
matters worse, denied my visit here.&rdquo; She turned
impulsively to Alan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will never know the suffering I have endured
since Monday,&rdquo; she said, and her voice quivered
with emotion. She read his expression, and a look
of hope, of joy, flashed up in her face. &ldquo;Am I forgiven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alan&rsquo;s arms were around her, his lips against hers.
&ldquo;You are loved,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Does not that cover
all?&rdquo; and he led her from the room.</p>

<p>Martha intercepted Miriam as she was on her
way to her own room an hour later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting downstairs,&rdquo; she said, pointing in
the direction of the living room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He?&mdash;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trenholm.&rdquo; And Martha who, since Corbin&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
arrest for complicity in Paul&rsquo;s murder and for
having narcotics concealed in his cache in the suicide&rsquo;s
grave, had kept carefully hidden in the kitchen
closet, stole softly to bed.</p>

<p>Trenholm dropped the paper he was reading as
Miriam paused in front of him, and sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hoped that you would come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Betty
and Alan are in the sunparlor. In our talk they
have cleared up the last threads of the mystery. It
seems that Betty&rsquo;s telegram to Paul was telephoned
out from Upper Marlboro and Alan wrote it down
on a slip of paper and gave it to him. It was to
secure that paper, Betty thinking it a regular telegraph
blank, that they both tried to search this house
and my bungalow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Abbott had a paper in his hand when he
told me that Miss Carter would be here,&rdquo; broke in
Miriam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then he must have carried it with him into
the sitting room, and dropped it on the way there,&rdquo;
replied Trenholm. &ldquo;Pierre found it and took it to
Mrs. Nash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A ghost of a smile hovered about Miriam&rsquo;s lips.
&ldquo;I cannot help but like Mrs. Nash,&rdquo; she confessed,
then changed the subject swiftly. &ldquo;What took Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
Abbott into the sitting room when I went downstairs
to admit Miss Carter and Doctor Nash?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm shook his head. &ldquo;We will never know,
but I imagine it was some sixth sense which warned
him of danger to the diamond&mdash;the gem seemed to
exert a remarkable influence over him. Poor Paul!&rdquo;
Trenholm sighed. &ldquo;His extraordinary will-power
triumphed over physical disability and gave him
strength to reach the sitting room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;I cannot shake
off a sense of responsibility for the tragedy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Trenholm spoke with the vehemence
characteristic of him. &ldquo;Never think that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miriam&rsquo;s smile did not dispel the shadow which
saddened her expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good-by, Mr. Trenholm,&rdquo; she said, holding
out her hand. &ldquo;I leave for Washington early to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trenholm&rsquo;s hand closed over hers with a pressure
that hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he repeated mechanically. &ldquo;No, I
can&rsquo;t let you go out of my life; for you have become
all in all to me.&rdquo; As he met the gaze of her lovely
eyes, his set speech, which he had rehearsed again
and again while waiting to see her, flew out of his
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miriam, I have only love to offer&mdash;&rdquo; His clear
voice faltered. For a second they gazed steadfastly
at each other, and the old, old story which never
grows old was told again as Trenholm clasped
Miriam to his heart and her lips met his in
unconditional surrender.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
